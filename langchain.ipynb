The exhibition is part of the exhibition program dedicated to the collection of Blanca and Borja Thyssen-Bornemisza.\\n\\nThis exhibition, curated by Guillermo Solana, is the first time that a monographic exhibition of the artist is held in a museum. The exhibition includes a selection of 17 large-format works made between 2019 and 2024, among which is Volador con castillo a la espalda (2021), which is part of the Thyssen-Bornemisza collection.\\n\\nRobert Nava moves away from academic conventions and develops a highly personal style associated with \"bad painting\" or \"bad painting\", a term used to describe works that defy the standards of good taste. Influenced by various sources such as prehistoric art, Egyptian, pre-Columbian culture, cartoons, as well as painting figures such as Jean-Michel Basquiat and Cy Twombly, Nava tries to create a new mythology that reflects the current era.\\n\\nHis works are full of hybrid creatures and zoomorphic monsters that inhabit scenes marked by some violence. Using expressive artistic strokes, along with a combination of sprays, acrylics and oils, the Brooklyn-based artist brings to life universes full of fantasy and imagination.\\n\\nCredits and images:\\n\\nRobert nava.

Thus, she introduces herself to Nikiya, a bayadera (a kind of priestess or sacred dancer in a Hindu temple) who is in love with a warrior named Solor. The latter also loves Nikiya, but is engaged to Gamzatti, the daughter of the Raja.\\r\\n\\r\\nGamzatti senses the attraction between Solor and Nikiya and everything gets complicated when finally the Raja discovers the love between the protagonists. After which, obfuscated by Solor's betrayal, he conspires to separate them.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis show is famous for its exquisite choreography, captivating music and stunning costumes. In addition, one of his most applauded scenes is the third act, known as the Kingdom of Shadows, where the bayaderas are exhibited in an ethereal and supernatural vision. Although initially not a great success, over time it has become one of the most acclaimed ballets in the classical repertoire.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Munich Ballet was founded in 1988 by Konstanze Vernon as an independent company, and was subsequently integrated into the Bayerische Staatsoper. Vernon was the director of the ensemble for the first ten years, and was succeeded by Ivan Liška. Since 2016, Russian Igor Zelensky has taken over the management. The group is made up of international dancers and has a repertoire of more than 80 works ranging from romantic ballet to the 21st century.\\r\\n\\r\\nFactsheet:\\r\\n\\r\\nChoreography - Patrice Bart\\r\\n\\r\\nOriginal choreography - Marius Petipa\\r\\n\\r\\nScenography and costumes - Tomio Mohri\\r\\n\\r\\nLighting - Maurizio Montobbio\\r\\n\\r\\nCostume making - Kumiko Sakurai\\r\\n\\r\\nOrchestra Direction - Kevin Rhodes\\r\\n\\r\\nProgram:\\r\\n\\r\\nMusic - Ludwig Minkus (1826-1917) with adaptation by Maria Babanina\\r\\n\\r\\nLibretto - Marius Petipa and Sergey Khudekov\\r\\n\\r\\nPremiered at the Imperial Bolshoi Kamenny Theater on 4 February 1877\\r\\n\\r\\nPremiered at the Teatro Real on September 4, 2008\",\n",

       "  'description': \"The Museo del Prado exhibits in room 10A, from March 19 to June 30, the work Still Life with ciders, oranges and rose by Francisco de Zurbarán. This excellent painting is considered one of the fundamental and masterpieces of the history of still lifes in Europe.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn loan from the Norton Simon Museum, the exhibition is curated by Javier Portús. The only still life dated by Zurbarán is part of the program La obra invitada, supported by the Fundación Amigos del Museo del Prado since 2010. The main axis of the project is the enrichment of the experience of the public through a comparative perspective that invites to reflect on the collection of the Prado.\\r\\n\\r\\nA native of Extremadura, Francisco de Zurbarán is considered one of the most outstanding painters of Spanish Baroque. The discovery in 1920 of this work now on display to the public contributed significantly to the reconstruction of the painter's catalog. Extremadura stands out for its ability to highlight the mysticism of the characters portrayed through the duality of lights and shadows. The author faithfully interprets nature through simplicity and veracity and making use of light effects of Caravaggiesque origin in order to achieve the sculptural of each form.\\r\\n\\r\\nImage credit:\\r\\n\\r\\nFrancisco de Zurbarán.

Supraconsciousness is a concept that refers to consciousness that exists beyond the mind and physical body.

In his family, there were no previous doctors, and he was the first to take that path. His interest in medicine aroused as a result of the stories about the Spanish civil war of his mother, an operating room nurse, and his father, who also worked in the field of health. He obtained the Bachelor of Medicine and Surgery at the University of Barcelona, faculty in which he is also later Associate Professor.\\n\\nHe specialized in General Digestive Surgery in the chair of Professor Dr. Pedro Piulachs of the Faculty of Medicine of the University of Barcelona, and subsequently fully dedicated his career at the University Hospital of Bellvitge.\\n\\nHe was a pioneer in the use of laparoscopy in General Surgery, and is a member of Societies of Surgery of Catalonia, Spain, France, England and Japan.\\n\\nHe is also Founder and President of the Association of Senior Physicians at Bellvitge University Hospital.\\n\\nDr. Manuel Sans Segarra's career has been guided by a commitment to the scientific method and a belief in the power of science to improve medicine.\\n\\nAn encounter changed his outlook During an emergency room guard, the Doctor's life took an unexpected turn.\\n\\nHe had the experience of resuscitating a patient who had suffered a clinical death as a result of a serious traffic accident.\\n\\nAfter surgery and successful progression, the patient shared with the Doctor a near-death experience he had experienced during his critical period of clinical death.\\n\\nThis experience motivated him to investigate further and learn about Near Death Experiences (NDEs). He studied the work of experts in the field such as Elizabeth Kuhler-Ross, Raymond Moody, Eben Alexander, Melvin Morse among others and met with professionals from various disciplines, neurologists, psychiatrists and psychologists to better understand these phenomena.\\n\\nThis encounter changed their perspective on life and death. He questioned his previous beliefs and led him to explore areas of medicine and consciousness that he had not previously considered. He began to see that there was more to our existence than can be explained through the Cartesian and Newtonian scientific method.\\n\\nDespite his scientific training, he came to the conclusion that the traditional scientific method could not fully explain these experiences. He sought answers in theoretical physics, which allowed him to better understand some of the phenomena reported by people who had lived through NDEs.\\n\\nTheoretical physics, especially quantum physics, offers a vision of the universe that goes beyond what we can perceive with our senses. This discipline suggests that reality is far more complex and mysterious than we normally perceive.\\n\\nThrough his study of theoretical physics, he began to appreciate that phenomena such as quantum overlap and entanglement could provide an explanation for some of the reported experiences in NDEs.\\n\\nThese last years, he is dedicating them to disseminate and share his knowledge, to help people awaken a deeper understanding of reality.\",\n",

These festivities, dedicated to a 12th-century farmer, have become a patron saint’s festivity where all visitors and citizens are completely immersed in the essence of the Madrid of yesteryear.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring these days, locals from Madrid and tourists go on a pilgrimage to the Hermitage of San Isidro located in the meadow that bears the same name to spend the day enjoying music, dancing and typical dishes of the festivity such as ‘entresijos’ (lamb mesentery) and ‘gallinejas’ (fried lamb intestines) or ‘rosquillas’ (small ring-shaped breadsticks) with sugar. Morning and afternoon, the San Isidro Meadow fills with visitors who celebrate along with the ‘chulapos’ and ‘chulapas’ dressed in traditional costume and who go there to enjoy a day outdoors where concerts, gastronomy and the festive atmosphere flood every corner of the city.\\r\\n\\r\\nBesides the Meadow, Las Vistillas and the Plaza Mayor are other key spots during the nights of San Isidro. Music takes centre stage on these festive nights in which live, traditional and independent music concerts and ‘verbenas’—popular night festivities—impress even the most demanding. At about midnight the Retiro Park fills with light and colour with fireworks launched from the monument dedicated to Alfonso XII.',\n",

       "  'description': \"Through a collection of pieces from the Musée National d'Art Moderne - Center d'Art Georges Pompidou in Paris, the space CaixaForum Madrid presents from 19 February to 9 June 2024 an exhibition that reflects on the past and present of the relationship between art and nature, between culture and science.\\n\\nThe exhibition consists of about eighty works of art, with an important presence of artists from the last decades who have contributed new compromised points of view. Painting, sculpture, photography, design and architecture in a cross-section, structured in four thematic sections: metamorphosis, mimicry, creation and threat. In a presentation that renounces didactic categorization or chronology, visitors will delve into the universe of nature, which, in the digital age, seems to be the last show of purity and truth.\\n\\nThe title of the exhibition recovers the term derived from the Greek bios (‘life’) and morphé (‘form’), which was incorporated into the historiography of the arts in the mid-1930s. At this time, in which we are witnessing multiple crises — climate, ecological and territorial — nature, as we know it, is in danger of disappearing, so it is necessary to reconsider our links with the world around us and on which we depend.\\n\\nImage credits:\\n\\nHervé Paraponaris, Sound System, 1993.

It can be visited in the Recoletos Room from March 7 to May 19.\\n\\nThrough his travels, books, inventions, projects and achievements, the exhibition details Betancourt's decisive contributions to civil engineering and his situation in the Europe of the Enlightenment, as well as the cosmopolitan character of this character and his contribution to the formation of a wide geographical space through which technical and engineering knowledge was transmitted and developed.\\n\\nBetancourt was born in Puerto de la Cruz (Tenerife). Throughout his life he traveled to Madrid, Paris, England and even Russia, where he died. The exhibition shows how in all these places he developed an extraordinary work in the field of civil engineering, obtaining the recognition of outstanding political and scientific authorities of the time. The public will be able to see his work for kings and ministers; his relations with technicians and entrepreneurs from different countries; how he studied new machines and invented many others; his foundation of the first engineering schools and museums in Spain or Russia; as well as his involvement in the formation of new technical cadres, being key in the creation of a new professional body of great later projection, that of road and canal engineers.\",\n",

Not only through material intervention but also through languages and creations of symbolic worlds that influence and shape it. Different devices and technologies enhance this effect. Our entire connection with reality is technologically mediated and if there is a technology - and a language - that has become the benchmark of this interaction is undoubtedly the video game.\\n\\nIt is possible today to conceive of the video game as a workshop for building citizenship, and as a language of communication capable of generating a remote dialog between the agents that inhabit urban, physical and virtual spaces. The interactive nature of digital games and the representation of the city in them stimulates the growth of a collective intelligence that, vividly, imagines and recursively writes the present and future of urban spaces.\\n\\nThis exhibition suggests a look at the video game from its capacity to think and transform the city, proposing a tour of different actions, projects and experiments that show how through this medium the urban is expressed and built.',\n",

Its picturesque streets and houses served as the setting for films by Almodóvar, Alejandro Amenábar or Álex de la Iglesia, and for music video clips by Manu Chao or Siniestro Total, and for zarzuelas (not in vain, Chueca is named after the composer Federico Chueca, who lived in the area). In addition, many of its bars are closely linked to the so-called \"Movida madrileña\". And for those who like urban art, its walls serve as a canvas for \"Pinta Malasaña\", a festival that has been held since 2015, and which beautifies even more, if possible, its streets and squares. There is also a lot of history here, like the one that was forged during the May 2 uprising in 1808. Its beautiful buildings treasure curious anecdotes, such as those related to the Bauer Palace, the Church of San Antonio de los Alemanes or the Royal Hospice de San Fernando, today the Madrid History Museum. And, if what you are interested in are the gruesome stories that make your hair stand on end, here are them to give and take: like the numerous murders that took place on Antonio Grillo Street, the one in the building on Pez Street where lived the disturbing Modlin family, the neighboring nuns of the convent of San Plácido who went mad in 1628, or the plaque of Eames Demetrios that announces that we are going to enter a world of darkness. During the tour, I will recommend endless restaurants, bars (my favorite: Rocablanca, in Fuencarral, where you will fall in love with their croquettes), curious things shops and ice cream parlors, which are for all tastes. And, to finish, you will receive a detail that will sweeten your day. I guarantee that you will enjoy.</p><p>Free tour: Book for free and pay what you want at the end</p>',\n",

After going down the impressive staircase of the Círculo de Bellas Artes and visiting the building inside, we will start walking the first stretch of Gran Vía, stopping at Loewe, the luxury brand where Ava Gardner bought his exclusive bags before going to celebrate the premiere of his films at Museo Chicote with a cocktail together with bullfighters like Luis Miguel Dominguín, as Almodovar has done later in the 80`s. We will visit the Telefónica Building, the first Madrid skyscraper, whose cultural Foundation we will access together. We will continue the journey through the second section of Gran Vía, knowing the old Paris-Madrid Mall, the first luxury shopping center in Madrid.

It is the oldest example of an illustrated Byzantine chronicle, the Synopsis Historiarum by John Scylitzes, with 574 miniatures that animatedly narrate the reign of the Byzantine emperors from 811 to 1057. The miniatures, rich in gold and lapis lazuli, offer unparalleled information about life in the Byzantine Empire.\\n\\nThe codex was made in Sicily, in the mid-12th century, at the Norman court. Two Italian-Greek scribes and seven miniaturists of very different artistic training participated in its creation, reflecting the multiculturalism of the time.\\n\\nThe National Library of Spain has selected fourteen manuscript bifolios for an exhibition, which have been subjected to a laboratory study by the Institute of Cultural Heritage of Spain.

       "  'name': 'Rigoletto Concert: Opera Garage Season',\n",
       "  'description': '“Rigoletto” is an opera in three acts with music by Giuseppe Verdi and a libretto in Italian by Francesco Maria Piave, based on Victor Hugo\\'s play The King Has Fun. Premiered on 11 March 1851 at the Teatro La Fenice in Venice, it forms together with El trovador and La Traviata, the popular operatic trilogy that Verdi composed in the middle of his career. It is a drama of passion, deception, filial love and revenge that has as its protagonist Rigoletto, the hunchback jester of the court of the Duchy of Mantua. Verdi explained that \"It contains extremely powerful positions... The theme is big, immense, and has a character that is one of the most important theater creations of all time.” The argument was highly controversial and Hugo himself had had problems with censorship in France, which had banned productions of this work after its first performance almost 20 years earlier (and would continue to be banned for another 30 years). Hugh\\'s work depicted a king (Francis I of France) as a cynical and immoral seducer, something that was unacceptable in the post-Napoleonic Wars Restoration Europe. They considered Hugo\\'s work to be on the verge of lese majeste, and would never allow such a scandalous work to be performed in Venice. One hundred and seventy years later, the drama is able to continue making us reflect on the same problem adapted to our times. The unbridled passion that leads to mistreatment, the deception that demands a thirst for revenge in the form of violence, the filial love for which we are capable of everything, even killing. But there are also fundamental issues where Verdi and Piave did not hesitate to point out: the abuse of power, the hostility of classism or corruption as a way of life. That is why, once again, I wanted to focus on contemporary social realities, problems that always affect us all directly or indirectly. Social exclusion and homelessness, street force in depressed neighborhoods or macho violence are present to complement this tremendous masterpiece. The curse is the “leitmotif” of the opera. The cruel expression of destiny to which no one can escape. Rigoletto is a sublime metaphor about hatred and rancor reflected in a score that contains some of the most beautiful and inspired fragments of music history. Emiliano Suárez',\n",

       "  'description': 'The Velázquez Palace, located inside the El Retiro Park, hosts from May 9 to September 1 an exhibition dedicated to one of the most enigmatic and striking figures of 20th century art. The exhibition brings together several works by James Lee Byars that give an account of his deep inquiry into everything that goes beyond the limits of logic.\\n\\nMoving between mysticism, spirituality and corporality, the visual and performative language of James Lee Byars (Detroit, Michigan, 1932 - Cairo, 1997) encompassed sculpture, installation, performance, drawing, word or assembly of his own exhibitions elaborated as installations.\\n\\nDuring the 1950s and 1960s, the artist resided between Japan and the United States, which greatly influenced his work. In addition, he maintained close ties with Italy, especially with Venice, where he resided and worked in the 1980s.\\n\\nByars fused knowledge of Western art and philosophy with elements of Nō theater and Zen Buddhism. His unique vision of reality focused on the perfection, cyclicality, and dematerialization of the human figure. It often involved the public in its temporary actions or large-scale interventions, raising direct or indirect questions.\\n\\nThe exhibition at the Velázquez Palace selects works that combine precious materials such as marble, silk, gold leaf or crystal, with minimal and archetypal geometries such as prisms, spheres and pillars. These pieces propose games of cross-references between form and content, inviting us to reflect on the material and the divine.\\n\\nCredits and images:\\n\\nJames Lee Byars, The Door of Innocence, 1986-1989 (foreground) and The Figure Question is the Room, 1986 (background).

In addition, the exhibition includes a section dedicated to her work as a graphic illustrator.\\n\\nAmong the paintings exhibited, we find some well-known and preserved works in museums, such as the famous oil painting Adam and Eve, which is in the Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sofía and with which Rosario de Velasco obtained in 1932 the second painting medal in the National Exhibition of Fine Arts. Also on display is La matanza de los inocentes (1936), belonging to the Museum of Fine Arts of Valencia.\\n\\nFor the first time, works that have been kept in the family and in private collections for many years are presented.

On stage, four actors specializing in physical theater, clown and burlesque, Matías Bassi, Elvira Gómez, Agustín Soler and Nicolás Gentile perform this play where the comic is tragic and so tragic that it is comic.\\n\\nRespecting Othelo's text, his poetry and dramatic tension, Chamé Buendia delves into the characters' intentions through the comic gag, generating a sinister irony in the tragedy. The work can be seen from July 12 to 28, with performances from Tuesday to Sunday.\\n\\nShakespeare shows us what we are capable of doing out of hatred and jealousy. And Gabriel Chamé Buendia presents us with this bet totally stripped of everyday realism, where the physical game and the white verse of the English master are confronted and complemented in a playful, hilarious and absurd language.\\n\\nAn investigation, without solemnity, of the relationship between the tragic and the comic, as keys to classical and contemporary theater. Othelo is an evil mirage in which approaching you you see nothing but sand.

       "  'description': \"The musical El Tiempo entre Costuras brings to the scene the life of Sira Quiroga that María Dueñas told us in her fast-paced novel. A story of love and fast-paced espionage, which moves with unstoppable pace through maps, memory and nostalgia, transporting us to the legendary colonial enclaves of North Africa, to the pro-German Madrid of the immediate postwar period and to a cosmopolitan Lisbon full of spies, opportunists and aimless refugees.\\nThe time between seams is an exciting adventure in which haute couture workshops, the glamor of big hotels, political conspiracies and the dark missions of the secret services merge with loyalty to those we love and with the irrepressible power of love. A novel of the old, a dressmaker thrown into adventure, love and heartbreak, war and peace.\\nIt has been one of the most awarded musicals in recent years with 10 Broadway World Spain Awards and 1 Talía Award, awarded by the Academy of Performing Arts. This version of Dueñas' work has been composed by Iván Macías and written by Félix Amador. Federico Barrios Fierro is the artistic director and Lorenzo Caprile and Marietta Calderón have been responsible for designing the costumes of the protagonist, Sara Quiroga.\\nThe time between seams, the musical has a cast of 21 actors who have been chosen after a thorough process of auditions. The role of the protagonist, Sira Quiroga, will be played by the actress Alba Cuartero who among her latest works are La historia interminable, the musical or El médico, the musical. Cristina Picos is an alternate in the role of Sira and Jan Forrellat plays Marcus; Teresa Alba is Candelaria; Gema Bastante is Rosalinda Fox; Paco Arrojo plays Da Silva; Rodrigo Blanco is Ramiro; Noemy Mazoy plays Dolores; Alberto Vázquez plays Gonzalo and Beigbeder; Gustavo Rodríguez plays Felix; Aurora Frías plays Doña Manuela; Patricia Carlos de Vergara is Jamila and Julio Morales plays Commissioner Claudio. The cast is completed with. Pablo Abad, Pedro Estrada, Camila Puelma, Noelia Cano, Esther Santaella, Guillermo Pareja, Fran León and Rocío Margón.\\nThe young dressmaker Sira Quiroga leaves Madrid in the months leading up to the start of the civil war dragged by runaway love for a man she barely knows. Together they settle in Tangier, a mundane, exotic and vibrant city where everything unthinkable can come true, even betrayal and abandonment.\\nAlone and beset by foreign debts, Syria moves to Tetouan, the capital of the Spanish Protectorate in Morocco. With unspeakable trickery and aided by friends of dubious reputation, she forges a new identity and manages to set up a select atelier in which she serves clients from remote and present origins.\\nFrom then on, with the Spanish contest just over and the European one about to begin, the fate of the protagonist is linked to a handful of historical figures among which Juan Luis Beigbeder —the enigmatic and scarcely known Foreign Minister of the first Franco regime—, his lover, the eccentric Rosalinda Fox, and the naval attaché Alan Hillgarth, head of British intelligence in Spain during the Second World War. Among them, she will be pushed towards a risky compromise in which the fabrics, stitches and patterns of her craft will become the visible façade of something much murkier and more dangerous.\\nYou can read our chronicle of the premiere in Madrid, at Espacio Delicias, by clicking here.\\n\\nAre you interested in this plan?\",\n",

       "  'description': 'A witness of the history of Madrid, the Teatro Español was originally a medieval space where small shows took place and pieces were premiered that would later become great classics of our literature. The same space that is occupied today in the Literary Quarter held shows in the Teatro Español at the end of the 16th century.\\n\\nSince then, after suffering various incarnations, in 1802 a large fire barely left the façade standing. It was then decided to reconstruct it, entrusting the task to Juan de Villanueva. Under the dictatorship of Primo de Rivera, Pablo Aranda made significant improvements to the marble and brought the technical facilities of the theater up to date.\\n\\nIn 1933, during the Second Republic, the Teatro Español became a National Theater, within an ample program of socio-cultural reformations. The arrival of the democracy coincided with another fire in the theatee. Rehabilitated again, in 1980 it returned to the hands of the City Hall of Madrid, its historical owner. It then annexed the building next to it, a third of the current total surface of the theater, which is used for very diverse applications. The last large refurbishment of Teatro Español (the 14th!) was in 1995.\\n\\nThe Teatro Español (Spanish Theatre) offers hour-long guided tours of the stalls, the boxes, the stage, the mayor’s box, the king’s box and private rooms, the tearoom, the Tirso de Molina room and even the chandelier that hangs from the top of the ceiling.',\n",

There were many conflicts in which his camera was present, always at the service of some noble cause on the part of the filmmaker. This commitment demonstrated the extent to which his level of involvement was honest and legitimate, regardless of the danger posed by the battlefield. He always moved by the call of duty, remembering in his patterns of action the war correspondents. He contributed to the war documentary over nearly four decades, between the 1930s and 1970s, making him a “war chronicler” in the full sense of the term. Pacifist or belligerent? Certainly, none of these antagonistic stances would serve as a blunt answer when defining his thinking. He was a person whose ideology did not defend war but revolution, understood as the necessary vehicle for the defense of the social rights of any people. This explains his strong connection with the Cuban cause, to which he contributed with Cuba, an armed people (1961). The contact with the Cuban guerrillas marked another of the key episodes in Ivens' life, both for his contribution to this film and for the activity as a film trainer of the members of the army. Over the years, there were many wars in which he participated, both actively (Spanish Civil War, II Sino-Japanese War, Vietnam War...) and from a distance (II World War). He always did it as a necessity in support of the oppressed. In other cases, his thought sought to reconcile the concepts of victory and peace. This was demonstrated by several of the titles made during his years after the Iron Curtain (1947-56), something he recovered for his film Le train de la victoire (The Victory Train, 1964), a road movie that documents the train journey of Salvador Allende in his campaign for the Chilean presidency of 1964. In this case, it was a struggle based on hope from a democratic perspective. Nearly ten years later, the events made the covert conflict a reality, giving Ivens' film a greater historical value.

The work will be performed from April 26 to June 2, with performances from Tuesday to Sunday.\\n\\nThanks to the theater and its ability to give voice to the revenants, returned or returned, born again on stage who can articulate their post-mortem story, Laura, a child kidnapped and murdered in the nineties, whose case was dismissed without the culprit being found, can tell her story and raise many questions.\\n\\nLaura asks the neighbors of her age, the commissioner in charge of the case and an educator. Do we educate in fear? Does fear prevent danger or avoid life? Is rape culture a secret society in light of day, as anthropologist and activist Rita Laura Segato puts it? What structures of abuse do we live with today?\\n\\nMaría Velasco invokes Laura so that she can articulate her post-mortem story and with lyricism and roundness, invites us to recover the memory of those who are no longer there to multiply our existence. The author, who was at that time the same age as Laura when she disappeared, explains how seeing the wanted posters with Laura's photo impressed her and influenced her later development as a woman.\\n\\nThis is why he introduces us to this exercise in hauntology (study of absences) and necromancy (divination of the future for the dead), which combines text, dance and music to dance a delayed mourning for all the minors killed in the nineties and for the girls who went out into the streets asking for forgiveness, with the feeling that the public space did not belong to them.\\n\\nArtistic file:\\n\\nLocation: Teatro Valle-Inclán - Sala Francisco Nieva\\n\\nText and address: María Velasco\\n\\nCast: María Cerezuela, Javiera Paz, Vida Priego, Francisco Reyes and Valeria Sorolla\\n\\nScenography: Blanca Añón\\n\\nLighting: Marc Gonzalo\\n\\nSculpture: Enrique Marty\\n\\nAudiovisuals: Miguel Ángel Altet\\n\\nSound Space: Peter Memmer\\n\\nChoreography: Joaquín Abella\\n\\nAssistant Director: Ruth Rubio\\n\\nCo-production: National Dramatic Center, National Theater of Catalonia, Ana Carrera and María Velasco (Sin of Hybris)\",\n",

This quality characterized much of the work of Joris Ivens, driven by nonconformity and a certain bohemian spirit that made him an inhabitant of the world. Going into nuances about the adventurous nature of Ivens, he was never just a traveler. He fully assumed this trait to the point of becoming stateless for much of his life, unable to take root anywhere else. In his later memoirs, he made this clear by presenting his life, with a certain idealized tone, as “the adventures of a young Dutch man who breaks with his country and goes out to discover the world with his camera”. It was this approach that led him to discover and explore places of all kinds, in many occasions providing a look detached from the pre-established discourse. In this sense, the multiple discursive layers present in ...a Valparaíso (1964) stand out, designed as an “urban tableau” complex that proposes a city in which important attractions and complicated contradictions coexist. Given the distance, exoticism was inevitable, something that does not happen with La Seine a rencontré Paris (El Seine, 1957), his other great urban proposal shot just a few years before. With this film, Ivens approached the field of \"film-essay\", highlighting his way of combining the sensory with all the human component that shows the river bed in its passage through Paris. Speaking of places, the case of Algeria could be considered as one of the great unfinished business in Ivens\\' career. This is not the case with Marceline Loridan, the Dutch man\\'s romantic partner in his last 25 years of life. This is the origin of Algérie, année zéro (Algeria, year zero, 1965), a production that introduces her fully into the committed documentary. It was a work marked by controversy when dealing with the independence of this former French colony, at the same time it arose in parallel with the first encounters with Ivens. Given the result, the connection between the two was assured by sharing the same adventurous and militant spirit, and it can be said that this work served to some extent to unite their two creative voices.

With a cast composed, among others, by Clemente García, Violeta Linde, Luís Moreno, Julia Piera, Nico Romero and Irene Serrano, this theatrical piece can be seen from May 8 to June 23, with performances from Tuesday to Sunday.\\n\\nThis work is a tribute to the work of two of the most surprisingly original artists of the 20th century: Heiner Müller and Rainer Werner Fassbinder. The work of these two German artists corroborates in many ways the devastation and chaos of the post-World War II years. Both wrote plays and made films that addressed the damaged human psyche after the persecution, destruction and madness had ended.\\n\\nAnd both expressed a radical critique of power systems, both at the personal and institutional level. In the Quartet, Heiner Müller’s 1980 play, a man and a woman face off in an increasingly theatrical sex role-play. Meanwhile, in Rainer Werner Fassbinder's 1971 film Warnung vor einer heiligen Nutte (Attention to that beloved prostitute), the actors and crew of a film wait in a Spanish hotel for the money to arrive that will allow them to continue shooting\\n\\nViolence, sociopathy, manipulation, control, imperialism, corruption, sexual crime... are some of the central themes of these two artistic works. Now playwright and director Dan Jemmett, using Quartet and Warnung vor einer heiligen Nutte motifs to create a new but equally vindictive work, Cats Die Like People.\\n\\nIn it, four performers sit in the lobby of a theater waiting for the director of the play they are currently working on to continue rehearsals. The play is Quartet. Also present in this ambigou is the writer, Heiner Müller, and a person who attends the bar.\\n\\nAs human relationships deteriorate within this group of people in a sociosexual game, the director appears from time to time to rail against working conditions in the theater and the impossibility of materializing his vision of the play.\\n\\nArtistic file:\\n\\nDramaturgy and direction: Dan Jemmett\\n\\nCast: Clemente García, Violeta Linde, Luís Moreno, Julia Piera, Nico Romero, Irene Serrano and others to be confirmed\\n\\nScenography: Adán Torres\\n\\nLighting: Felipe Ramos\\n\\nCostume: Vanesa Actif\\n\\nVideo and Sound Space: Christopher Knighton\\n\\nPlaywright: Brenda Escobedo\\n\\nProduction: National Dramatic Center\",\n",

A journey that takes visitors from the Admiral's journey to the conquest of space today, through some moments in the history of exploration and the discovery of new worlds, from Christopher Columbus's journey in 1492, which changed the course of history by revealing a new continent, to the iconic Apollo 11 moon landing in 1969.\\n\\nThe multifaceted artist has created more than 20 sculptures inspired by artifacts and objects that have been present on NASA missions and a series of meteorite recreations. On these works Denise De la Rue establishes a dialog and overlaps excerpts of the aforementioned Columbus letters and documents from the Apollo Missions, such as the document of the Apollo 11 moon landing belonging to the National Archive Museum in Washington D.C. In addition to these unpublished pieces, the exhibition incorporates artistic replicas of objects from the NASA collection and the pilot Buzz Aldrin, who participated in the first trip to the moon in 1969.\\n\\nImage credits:\\n\\nTitle to be determined, from the signature of Christopher Columbus juxtaposed with a sphere of meteorite Seymcham.\",\n",

Her other two married daughters live far away from Leenane and Maureen, who remains single in her forties, has to take care of the feeding and other care of her mother, very limited in movement, even hurt in one hand. Their respective characters, flawed by silences and lies, and marked by domestic routines, by a tense and repressive mother-to-child relationship, by traumatic acts from the near past and by a history of reciprocal damage that will be revealed throughout the action, will be altered by a local episode: the eventual return to Leenane de Pato Dooley, who works as a laborer in London, on the occasion of a family farewell party to an uncle who returns to America after the holidays. The circumstance will lead to the reunion of Pato and Maureen, which will cause an evident displeasure in the old woman as well as a chain of situations between mother and daughter with dramatic consequences, and visits to the house of Mag and Maureen of Ray Dooley, younger brother of Pato, a boy with short social and work expectations. On the one hand, the sentimental relationship generated between Duck and Maureen, after the party, in addition to imprisoning Mag, will create a state of self-deception in Maureen and of acute confrontation with his mother. While, on the other hand, the mother's concealment of news, messages and a letter, especially one in which Pato proposes to Maureen leave with him to Boston, will lead to a violent outcome, whose scenario will remain the immutable living room-kitchen-dining room space of the house.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u200c\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u200c\\r\\n\\r\\nARTISTIC AND TECHNICAL RECORD\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u200c\\r\\n\\r\\nCAST:\\r\\n\\r\\nMAG - MARIA GALIANA\\r\\n\\r\\nMAUREEN - LUCIA QUINTANA\\r\\n\\r\\nDUCK - JAVIER MORA\\r\\n\\r\\nRAY.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u200c\\r\\n\\r\\nPRODUCTION: OKAPI PRODUCTIONS\\r\\n\\r\\nADDRESS: JUAN ECHANOVE\\r\\n\\r\\nADAPTATION: BERNARDO SÁNCHEZ\\r\\n\\r\\nASSISTANT DIRECTOR: MARCO MAGOA\\r\\n\\r\\nCOSTUME DESIGN: ANA GARAY\\r\\n\\r\\nSTAGE DESIGN: ANA GARAY\\r\\n\\r\\nSTAGE AND COSTUME ASSISTANT: ISI PONCE\\r\\n\\r\\nLIGHTING DESIGN: DAVID PICAZO\\r\\n\\r\\nSOUND DESIGN: ORESTES GAS\\r\\n\\r\\nPHOTO: Sergio Parra\\r\\n\\r\\nMAKEUP & HAIRDRESSING: Chema Noci\",\n",

His words are words that speak of mourning, but also - and above all - of life, of the light that surrounds it and that surrounds us, words that stir and excite because all that counts are us, are our mothers, our common history, which makes us part of the same whole.

In a postmodern context, this discipline stands as an alternative to organize knowledge about the interrelations between the natural, the social and the cultural.\\n\\nThe permanent collections of museums are not excluded from this analysis; they not only represent the identity of each institution, but also reflect the changes and traces that time has left in the geographical configuration of the cities to which they belong.\\n\\nEach work represents a new way of perceiving and producing space, codifying social and natural strata. The collection acts as a \"territorial research agency\", exploring urban transformations and social and political analyzes. Madrid, as a European capital, presents itself as a stage where micro and macro-cultural converge, reflecting the global and the subjective. The exhibition presented by the Museum of Contemporary Art and the Department of Exhibitions advocates an interdisciplinary approach to understanding the tensions between urban histories and the subjectivity of artists in contemporary reality.',\n",

       "  'description': \"The French-Spanish painter Roberta González ((Paris, 1909 - Neufmontiers, 1976) stars in what is her first solo exhibition in Madrid, within the Museum of Contemporary Art. The artist, virtually unknown despite her great artistic ability and her skills for painting and drawing, lived in the shadow of her father, Julio González, a prominent sculptor and representative of the artistic avant-garde of the early twentieth century, and her husband, the German abstract painter Hans Hartung. The exhibition can be visited until September 22, 2024.\\n\\nThe exhibition consists of several works belonging to the collection of Vicente García Sambenito, from Paris and formed by a series of unpublished pieces of different techniques and supports, something that increases the novelty of this exhibition project. From different periods between 1940 and 1975, Roberta González's works show the evolution, but also the persistence of her interests and her language in these years. There are drawings, both the children who interested Picasso, and those made during the German occupation of Paris, revealing the environment in which he lived. Then he returned to painting, to the combination of abstraction and figuration, to the presence of the female portrait, to color, to symbols like crosses and to elements of nature. A dual and contrasting language revealing vital and personal contradictions. All this without forgetting the influence of the work of his father, Julio González.\\n\\nRoberta González developed an important career in the complex world of Parisian art from the 30s to the 70s. A woman in a male universe, she was the only artist at the Prague Exhibition in 1948. His work, carried out over more than four decades, responds both to the characteristics of the artistic environment of the time — Cubism, abstraction, surrealism, etc. — and to the impulse of a personality of its own, which gives rise to an original creative tension that develops over different stages.\",\n",

The content is strongly humorous, but it records as its central section a talk about issues related to art, history, myths, science, and other areas of culture. The program has a short music section where the conductors sing and play instruments. Often, renowned singers participate. Also, over the years, short musical comedies, lasting about twenty-five minutes, written especially for the radio and performed by consecrated figures, have been made.\\n\\nJoan Manuel Serrat, Mercedes Sosa, Jairo, China Zorrilla, Jaime Torres, Julia Zenko, Juan Carlos Baglietto, Ana María Cores, Esther Goris, Jorge Luz, Víctor Heredia, Guillermo Fernández, Cecilia Milone, Suma Paz, Juanjo Domínguez, etc. More than a conventional radio show, Revenge will be terrible is a small everyday theatrical experience.

A man who, at the age of 59, realized he had only a few grains of sand left and decided to seek life wherever the current was strongest.\\n\\nHe embarked on a journey on foot that took him around the world for 8 years, pulling his own coffin, in which he slept and kept his few belongings, in search of his best friend.\\n\\nWhy did you decide to travel by pulling your own coffin? A reminder of the end of the journey, the end that makes us all equal.\\n\\nIn each of us, always immobile, always in motion, independent of our will, there is an hourglass. We change, he, impassive, fulfills his destiny. The passage of time unites us in an adventure, life, whose result will be the same for all.\\n\\nWe can earn more money, goods, friendships, or power, but we cannot earn more time than our hourglass contains.\\n\\nL.I.H.E.D. takes inspiration from the story of Elzéar Duquette to convey that life is ephemeral, but that time is extended when we invest it in being happy.\",\n",

A briefcase that shines a light that dazzles everyone present.

We realized that the theater was a bit orphaned from similar proposals. It is difficult to see on a stage a proposal that approaches the thriller or the most rampant action films. To do this, we have taken the references that we are most passionate about in this genre: the films of Tarantino, Guy Ritchie and the master of house, Álex de la Iglesia. A Night in the Alhelí is a proposal that aims to engage, surprise and entertain.

Through this archeological project and the various scientific techniques used for it, the diachronic account of this way of life is evidenced.\\n\\nThe title of the exhibition takes inspiration from Cicero, who perfectly describes the current meaning of the Mediterranean diet: “And I did not measure the delight of these meals both by the pleasures of the body and by the encounter and chat with friends.

In parallel with his career in film, David Trueba has maintained a great literary activity, has published six novels and has also published as a press writer. Now he takes the leap to the theater and debuts with this contemporary play that will be seen from April 24 to June 9, with performances from Tuesday to Sunday.\\n\\nAnna Alarcón and Vito Sanz give life to Nuria and Pablo, two friends who grew up in the same working class and marginal neighborhood, but who over the years separated them and made their lives go different ways. Pablo is now a lawyer specializing in solidarity cases and has not been in the streets of the slum where they grew up for a long time. Nuria, however, has remained stuck in time, without many options or opportunities. Two different versions of the target.\\n\\nAfter years of not knowing about each other, Nuria contacts her old friend to help her with a legal matter. When she finds him again and asks for help, Paul cannot refuse, because he feels that there is something that ties him to her, that makes them a kind of mutual reflection. This approach will force them to face their own lives and to review the common past, to remember the innocent and failed love story they lived.\\n\\nThe reunion will serve to listen to the other, to understand those divergences that led them to leave definitively. The title of the play, The Handsome, speaks to the fragility of the one who was once desired. Nuria never lived up to the expectations that the rest of the people projected on her because what they did was project their own fantasies.\\n\\nArtistic file:\\n\\nLocation: Teatro María Guerrero - Sala Grande\\n\\nText, Address - David Trueba\\n\\nCast - Anna Alarcón and Vito Sanz\\n\\nScenography and costumes - Beatriz San Juan\\n\\nLighting - Pedro Yagüe\\n\\nMusic and sound space - Iñaki Estrada\\n\\nManagement Assistant - Aina Tur\\n\\nPoster Design - SOPA Team\\n\\nProduction - Bito and Centro Dramatico Nacional\\n\\nStrobe lights are used during the function',\n",

The Suñol Soler Collection thus establishes a unique dialog showing Warhol's works and photographs from the series.\\n\\nAndy Warhol and Fernando Vijande met at The Factory studio (New York) in the late 1960s, but Warhol did not visit Spain until 1983 for the opening of his exhibition Pistolas, Cuchillos, Cruces, at the Galería Fernando Vijande in Madrid. A visit in which he was accompanied by Fred Hughes and his friend and collaborator, the photographer Christopher Makos.\\n\\nVijande's fascination with the painter led him to acquire in 1975 a large-format portrait of Mao for Josep Suñol's collection, belonging to the 10 Early Maos series. This acquisition marked the beginning of a close collaboration between the gallery owner and the collector and the creation of one of the most outstanding private collections of contemporary art in Spain, the Suñol Soler Collection.\\n\\nAnother of the works that can be seen in the exhibition is the silkscreen 128 of the series Ladies and Gentlemen, by Warhol, which Vijande bought for the Josep Suñol Collection. In 1975, the Italian dealer Anselmino commissioned Warhol to create a series, originally called Drag Queens, that portrayed New York's drag and trans community. For this, she had models from The Gilded Grape, a local of young trans performers and drags of black and Latin origin.\\n\\nIt should be noted that within the exhibition are included the collections of photographers Pablo Pérez Mínguez, Javier Trillo, Teresa Nieto and Javier Porto, with the aim of articulating and completing a visual and sociological tour of Warhol's visit to Madrid and the exhibition, previously mentioned, of Pistolas, Knives, Crosses in 1983.\\n\\nCredits and images:\\n\\nFernando Vijande, 1983.

Curated by Rahiem Shadad and António Pinto Ribeiro, this exhibition was previously hosted by the Brotéria Gallery in Lisbon.\\n\\nThe reflection of the turmoil of the revolution of the recent years 2018 and 2019 tries to be reflected in this exhibition both through traditional techniques and through experimental stories.\\n\\nCasa Árabe, being a space formed to strengthen ties between cultures, aims to publicize the events that occurred in this country that develops between the Arab and African world. Mohammed A. Otaybi, Rashid Diab, Tariq Nasre and Eltayeb Dawelbait are among the artists who make up this evolutionary exhibition of Sudanese modern and contemporary art.\",\n",

       "  'description': 'From April 9 to July 20, the Exhibition Hall of the Banco de España hosts an exhibition that brings together nearly 300 photographs of architecture, public events and portraits of employees, from 1869 to the present. Images of a hundred photographers of recognized prestige, most unpublished, which represent the testimony of the graphic image of the institution over the last 150 years.\\n\\nThis exhibition reflects the life of the Bank of Spain and the country from the middle of the nineteenth century to today, using a tour composed of 300 images of photographers of recognized prestige that are part of the Archive of the Bank of Spain. The exhibition has a dual purpose: to enhance its role as a guarantor of memory and disseminate funds, thus fulfilling the commitment to share and make available to the public its rich historical heritage.\\n\\nThe exhibition covers a chronological line divided into five sections: The Yellow Time (19th century), Photography as a Document (1900-1925); From the Silver Age to the Transition (1925-1975); Spain is different (1975-2023); and Towards Artificial Intelligence (21st century).\\n\\nIn addition, it has three different aspects: the portrait as an identifying element, the spaces and the activities of the institution. All provide social readings from the contents, and, in a concrete way, on urbanism, architecture, public works, people and customs.\\n\\nCredits and images:\\n\\nMadrid.

All the stories depicted act as capsules of time yet to come, as if they were emissaries of futures that challenge our current perceptions and propose alternative narratives capable of shaping tomorrow from unexpected perspectives.\\n\\nEach of the six windows that open in the room becomes a space from which to project different realities, new hypotheses of futures, inviting the viewer to a reconsideration of the way we think about the future and favoring a dialog between our present reality and those that could occur during the next decades. In this exercise of applied imagination, technology intervenes as an essential part of the creative process of artists to materialize their visions.\\n\\nHe has collaborated in advising the project the interdisciplinary study dedicated to the prospective research and design of futures, Invisible, to accompany the artists in the elaboration of the conceptualization process and the theoretical framework of each of the works.\\n\\nThe exhibition is part of a narrative trilogy about the future started with two previous exhibitions, The Great Imagination. Stories from the future and Liam Young. Build worlds, both focused on projecting fictional scenarios and alternative worlds from technology.\\n\\nImage credits:\\n\\nLifeforms.

The montage is based mainly on classical history, but to which many additions have been added by authors such as Tirso de Molina, Molière or Lord Byron. Also included are issues from Lorenzo da Ponte's libretto for Mozart and texts that are not related to it, such as a sonnet by Francisco de Quevedo sung to a duet or another by Sister Juana Inés de la Cruz who performs at a given moment Dona Inés.\\n\\nIn this way we seek to update this legend through the main characters, to which we add a new vocality, but at the same time allows a clear understanding of the story. For this purpose, a small choir or quartet of madrigalists who assume several secondary roles and who comment on the action is used, along with the chamber group that accompanies the piece vocally and instrumentally.\\n\\nArtistic file:\\n\\nMusic Direction - Santiago Serrate\\n\\nScene Direction - Grupo Señor Serrano\\n\\nConfigurinistas - Joan Ros Garrofe and Atena Pou Clavell\\n\\nScenography and lighting - CUBE.BZ\\n\\nVideo Producer - Xavier Gilbert\\n\\nCostume - Joan Ros Garrofé\\n\\nChoir Direction - José Luis Basso\\n\\nAllocation:\\n\\nTenorio - Joan Martín-Royo\\n\\nDon Luis - Juan Francisco Gatell\\n\\nDoña Inés - Adriana González\\n\\nThe Narration - Juan Antonio Sanabria\\n\\nAna - Cristina Faus\\n\\nLucía - Sandra Ferrández\\n\\nChoir and Orchestra Holders of the Royal Theater\\n\\nProgram:\\n\\nChamber Opera\\n\\nMusic and libretto by Tomás Marco (1942), based on Don Juan Tenorio by José Zorrilla, with additions by Tirso de Molina, Molière, Lorenzo da Ponte, Lord Byron, sor Juana Inés de la Cruz and Francisco de Quevedo\\n\\nPremiered in concert version at the Summer Festival of the Theater-Auditorium of San Lorenzo de El Escorial in 2017\\n\\nAbsolute premiere in stage version\\n\\nNew production of the Royal Theater\",\n",

They place monarchs, savage dictators to subdue their people. They come to Judea. And there a princess, Salome, secretly supports the rebels who resist the rule of King Herod, that corrupt puppet appointed by Rome. A man without morals who rules without law.\\n\\nJohn the Baptist, the spiritual leader of his people, cries out against the invader and is held captive in the prison of Herod's Palace. Give life for a New Time. He's a Prophet. He says hope is the breath of all dreams. And it ignites the Princess's desire. Salome, lost in the head of his beloved John the Baptist, suffers. Rejected by him, she transforms into a bleeding woman.\\n\\nSalome, expression of the Absolute Sensual Power, extreme his desire for the Baptist. A desire that overflows in death.\\n\\nLove and death live in a permanent embrace, and Salome breaks the red line that leads to delirium. Induced by her mother Queen Herodias, she dares to ask her stepfather the King for the head of the Baptist.\\n\\nHerodias is a woman used and abused by power. A woman in need of freedom. Herodias is stumbling in a land of repressions that ignores and stonewalls women if they abandon strict morals.

I was going through a crisis of a professional, seemingly professional kind, but it was really about something deeper. He had achieved a resounding success with the setting up of Alfonso Sastre's “La taberna fantastica” and it was just what he wanted. But after this I was paradoxically not happy, but despondent and with a truly alarming sense of emptiness and fatigue. You got it, I said, was this and now what? Then fell into my hands the book of Yogananda, poetry and knowledge. The vital adventure of a man searching for the ultimate mystery of existence and the ultimate certainty of having found it. That's when his search ended. The revelation of God's joy. The story is endearing, human, simple and of great beauty. I never forgot this book. He left a seed. Now I think I already connected with Yogananda and he waited for me for 30 years. Throughout all this time I had to prepare. He did it with all sorts of events. A lot of them pretty tough, by the way. Others were like blessings and portentous gifts, almost miraculous, that I would never have expected. And finally, a couple of years ago, a friend of mine gave me another book by Yogananda. I was reading it at home when an inner inspiration set me in motion. I hope that the wisdom, charm, magic, light and love of this story will inspire and accompany you.”\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nRafael Álvarez, THE WITCH.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFUNCTIONAL DIVERSITY FOR WHEELCHAIR USERS\\r\\n\\r\\nTickets of this type are not available in the system, but can be managed through our telephone sales service on 902 400 222 or from any shopping center with ticket sales service, Monday to Friday from 10:00 to 15:00 and from 16:00 to 18:00 non-public holidays.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE USE OF A MASK IS MANDATORY THROUGHOUT THE PREMISES\",\n",

From the name of the protagonist, \"Pacifico\", to the terrible end of the work, the Vallisoletano author defended throughout his pages peace in the face of war and non-violence as a way of life. As an adaptor I wanted to highlight the complex character of Pacifico Pérez, his submission to the powerful, his almost Franciscan resignation to a fate engraved in his memory from the cradle with the stories of the wars told to him by the Grandfather, the Bisa and Father. I have followed the original scheme of the novel of Pacific\\'s seven interviews with the prison psychiatrist. In them he expresses himself with complete freedom and with the best rural Castilian language, which he so rightly granted to him by his original author.\\n\\nI must acknowledge in these lines, above all, the very grateful collaboration received by the actor Carmelo Gómez (a native of a town in León), who with both enthusiasm and knowledge has worked with me to \"polish\" the latest version of the text that we are now presenting.

       "  'name': 'Concert Opera Cycle - Madama Butterfly',\n",
       "  'description': 'Madama Butterfly by Giacomo Puccini is one of the most acclaimed and frequently performed operas internationally. Few operas in the usual repertoire thrill and surprise audiences like this masterpiece from the early 20th century (1904). Based on David Belasco\\'s theatrical drama, its wonderful orchestration and melodic inspiration, veristic and at the same time exotic and extremely passionate, have made it one of the most tragic and at the same time most penetrating and emotional stories of all time. Two-hour staged version with 15-minute intermission. Symphony orchestra integrated into the show, solo singer, choir, ballet, period costumes, lighting and unique technical assembly, taking advantage of the special features of the concert hall of the EDP Gran Vía Theater in Madrid. More than 70 artists on the scene!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nACT I: In 1904, Benjamin Franklin Pinkerton, an American Navy officer, acquires a house on a hill overlooking the city and port of Nagasaki (Japan) for himself and his future wife, the young Cio-Cio San. A marriage that has been rigged by matchmaker Goro through a Japanese law that allows him to renounce the young woman whenever he wants. For Pinkerton it is an adventure outside his country, his secret intention is to divorce the young woman once he finds the right American wife; instead for Cio-Cio San this is a commitment for life. So much so that, prior to the link, he secretly converts to Christianity.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe wedding is about to be held in the house with friends and guests of the bride, the American consul Sharpless and the official registrar. Sharpless warns Pinkerton of the young woman\\'s passionate feelings and recommends that he be careful not to hurt her. Cio-Cio San\\'s uncle, the Buddhist monk Bonzo, who has discovered his niece\\'s conversion, shows up at the ceremony to curse and disown the young woman and order the guests to leave. The young woman, whom Pinkerton will call Butterfly, who has given up everything she had to become his wife, falls heartbroken at the rejection of her own but at the same time feels happy and ecstatic and marries Pinkerton and they have their first passionate night of love (“Vogliatemi bene”).\\r\\n\\r\\nACT II: It has been three years since Pinkerton left to return to his country. Butterfly lives alone in the hill house with her maid Suzuki and the son born after the departure of her father, who knows nothing of the child\\'s existence. Suzuki tries to convince Butterfly that he will not return, but she does not listen to him and is always faithful waiting for his return with hope (\"A beautiful green day\"). Before leaving, Pinkerton left the girl a substantial sum of money that has allowed her to live smoothly, but now the money is running out. Goro, the matchmaker who arranged Pinkerton\\'s marriage, continues to try to remarry her, but Butterfly does not listen to him either, despite the extreme poverty he experiences.\\r\\n\\r\\nSharpless, the American consul, arrives at the house accompanied by Goro and informs Butterfly that he has received a letter from Pinkerton announcing his return. Butterfly\\'s overflowing joy at hearing the news prevents Sharpless from telling him the real reason for his return. Sharpless tries to read the rest of the letter to him and make him see that it is possible for her husband to come with intentions not to stay and asks him what he would do if Pinkerton did not come home. Butterfly replies that, in that case, she should choose between becoming a geisha again or taking her own life, but is convinced that she will change her mind when she sees her son. The alarmed consul, who was unaware of the facts, promises to inform Pinkerton of the matter and at the same time tries to persuade the young woman to marry the wealthy Yamadori.',\n",

Morales announces to Don José that a \"beautiful girl has come asking for him\", and that he will return. Lieutenant Zúñiga, nine in the province, asks José what he knows about the building on the other side of the square. It is a tobacco factory, where only women work. The bell rings. It\\'s break time for the factory cigarette makers. An operative, the most anticipated of all, soon appears: she is Carmen, and all men celebrate her. She looks at Don José, approaches him and they engage in a brief conversation. Micaela arrives and announces to Don José that she is coming from her mother. She sends him a letter advising him to marry the letter-bearer, because \"there is none better and gentler\". There is a major altercation at the factory doors. Carmen has mocked an operator, who has assaulted her, and Carmen has scratched her face with a knife. Zúñiga interrogates Carmen and makes her arrest. Don José will be in charge of taking her to prison. Carmen begins to seduce her kind guardian. He eventually convinces the brigadier to let her run away, and manages to escape.\\n\\n\\n\\nACT II: Two months later, officers meet at the tavern of Lillas Pastia, a notorious smugglers\\' meeting point, where Carmen is singing. There is also Lieutenant Zúñiga, who informs Carmen that Don José was demoted and arrested for letting her flee and that he has just served the punishment. Don José, who has already been released from prison, appears and shows Carmen his love for her. The bugle sounds, and Don José must return to unity. Carmen asks him that if he wants to give proof of true love he will have to follow her in the company of the smugglers. But for Don José, this means the shame and infamy of deserting, and for a moment he decides to abandon it. At that moment, Lieutenant Zúñiga arrives, who breaks through the door. He wants to kick Don Jose out for bonding with Carmen. Don José, enraged, draws the sword. The smugglers immobilize and disarm Zúñiga and decide to hold him for a while. “Are you one of us now?” Carmen asks Don José, who replies, “I have no choice.” Carmen, the gypsies and the smugglers promise Don José a life full of freedom.\\n\\n\\n\\nACT III: We are on the mountain, where the smugglers\\' camp is. Carmen and Don José argue. She says her love is not like it used to be. Don José thinks of his mother and Carmen advises him to leave, because he is definitely not made for this kind of life. The smugglers launch the operation when, suddenly, accompanied by a guide, Micaela arrives at the camp. Don José, who stands guard, shoots a stranger, but fails. It is Escamillo, the bullfighter, who explains to Don José that he comes to meet Carmen, because according to what he has been told he no longer loves the soldier who made him defect. Both men fight in a knife fight. Escamillo slips and falls. When Don José is about to hurt him, Carmen enters and prevents him.',\n",

Staged version of two hours with 15 minutes of intermission. Symphony orchestra, solo singers, choir, ballet, costumes, unique lighting, adapted to the special characteristics of the EDP Gran Vía Theater in Madrid. More than 60 artists on the scene!\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Traviata, by G. Verdi, based on the novel The Lady of the Camellias by A. Dumas\\'s son. Paris and surroundings, 1880.\\n\\n\\n\\nACT I: Violetta Valéry, celebrated courtesan, offers a party in the living room of her house in Paris. Count Gastone introduces himself to his friend Alfredo Germont, a young nobleman who has long been in love with Violetta. As they stroll through the salon, Gastone explains to Violetta that Alfredo loves her, and that, when she was sick, she would come to her house every day to take an interest in her health. Baron Douphol, Violetta\\'s current lover, is expected to accompany her to the salon, where she is asked to make a toast. He refuses and then it is Alfredo who invites those present to raise the glasses, playing the well-known Libyan heart duo ne\\' lieti calici.\\n\\nVioletta feels dizzy and asks to be allowed to rest until she recovers. Alfredo enters and is worried about his delicate health and declares his love. At first, Violetta rejects him. However, when the young man is about to leave, she gives him a flower to return when it is withered.\\n\\nThe guests are leaving. Alone, Violetta, accustomed to enjoying life freely and untethered, wonders if the attractive suitor she just met could be the love of her life. Outside the scene, Alfredo\\'s voice is heard singing to love, while she sings to freedom (Always free!).\\n\\n\\n\\nACT II: Scene 1a. Three months later, Alfredo and Violetta live together in a quiet country house on the outskirts of Paris. Violetta is in love and has totally abandoned her previous life. Annina, the maid, arrives and tells Alfredo that she has just sold much of Violetta\\'s belongings in Paris so that she can afford to retire to life in the countryside. Alfred, surprised, marches to Paris to deal with the matter himself. Violetta returns home and receives an invitation from her friend Flora for a party in Paris that same night. A servant announces a visit. It is Alfredo\\'s father, Giorgio Germont, who asks the lady to break off the relationship with his son, as Violetta\\'s bad reputation threatens his daughter\\'s engagement to a young man of good family. With great remorse and horror, she accedes to Germont\\'s cruel request. Violetta gives Annina a note addressed to Flora in which she accepts the invitation to the party. He sets out to write a letter to Alfredo, when he suddenly appears and she can barely control the sadness. He repeatedly tells her of his unconditional love and says goodbye to him without explanation with the famous phrase \"Amami Alfredo!\". Before leaving for Paris, Violetta gives her servant the letter she has written for Alfredo. Reading it, he feels faint. Germont appears at this moment and tries to comfort her son. But Alfredo suspects that the baron is behind this separation, since the invitation to the party of Flora that he finds on the table of the office confirms it. Enraged, he decides to come to the party that night. Germont tries to stop him without succeeding.\\n\\nScene 2a. At the party, the Marquis de Obigny explains to Flora that Violetta and Alfredo have separated. The hostess asks the artists to entertain the guests. Gastone and his friends join the bullfighters and sing. Violetta arrives with Baron Douphol.',\n",

And provide it with new and magical effects that enhance the world of the beyond, with illusionism, music and projections, so that viewers live an immersive experience of terror. A fascinating genre and attractive to the general public, both in literature and the small or large screen, but that has rarely been taken to the theater. In addition, the text connects with the most animal essence of the human being, therefore it is inevitable to identify oneself and for that reason it is a unique experience.\\n\\nPrepare your five senses and be alert because you will feel THE FEAR …',\n",

The work can be seen from April 5 to May 26, with performances from Tuesday to Sunday.\\n\\nCalderón's mythological comedies represent the culmination of Baroque theater as a fusion of the arts, and the wonder of the verses that encloses this theatrical piece claims that we place it as one of the summit works of Don Pedro.\\n\\nInspired by the Achilles episode in Sciros, when he is hidden by his mother, the nymph Tetis, in the court of King Lychomedes, disguised as a woman so that the prophecy of his death in Troy is not fulfilled. Calderón puts the myth at the service of his philosophical concerns and turns Achilles into Sigismund.\\n\\nThus, we see the budding hero emerging from the cave in which his mother has kept him locked up for fifteen years, practically born into the world, and we follow him on an initiatory journey, through the honeys and the fires of love, until we glimpse the hero who will be in Troy.\\n\\nThe Calderonian scenic force is manifested by instilling vitality into mythology and adapting to its time the concern about being and destiny through the episode of Achilles in the gynoecium.\\n\\nArtistic file:\\n\\nCast: Iñigo Arricibita, Xavi Caudevilla, Cristina García, Ania Hernández, Nora Hernández, Antonio Hernández Fimia, Pascual Laborda, Cristina Marín-Miró, Felipe Muñoz, Miriam Queba, María Rasco and Marc Servera\\n\\nIñaki Rikarte\\n\\nAssistant Director: Rolando San Martín\\n\\nVerse Advisor: Vicente Fuentes\\n\\nCostume: Ikerne Giménez\\n\\nMusical composition: Luis Miguel Cobo\\n\\nSound space: Luis Miguel Cobo\\n\\nProduction: National Classic Theater Company\\n\\nDuration: 120 minutes\\n\\nIt has magnetic loop, amplified sound with headphones, audio description and surtitling for the deaf.\",\n",

       "  'description': \"The Margarita Xirgu room of the Spanish Theater hosts a play by Édouard Louis, adapted by Daniele Sarriugarte and directed by Fernando Bernués. The play is performed by Eneko Sagardoy, winner of the Goya Award for Best New Actor in 2016, who plays Édouard Louis himself. Supporting her monolog is the veteran and multifaceted Eva Trancón, who incarnates the author's mother. The work can be seen from June 20 to July 7, with performances from Tuesday to Sunday.\\n\\nThe work shows the metamorphosis of a woman destroyed by patriarchal society, the family and even her son, before both celebrate their reunion and that Édouard Louis publicly restore the dignity taken from his mother.\\n\\nIn the original work, from the chance encounter of a self-portrait of his mother's youth, the author recalls the figure of that woman separated from everything, subjugated and even humiliated by male violence. A woman who, at the age of 45, rebels, flees and, little by little, builds her freedom.\\n\\nThis new theatrical commitment goes beyond photographic portraiture and for this reason, Édouard Louis himself invites his mother to share a scene, at all times, with him. She will be a silent presence, except for brief and punctual verbal interventions, which will be reinforced by the projection, in two bands, of a close-up of her transiting, “in situ”, through the emotional recesses of this courageous text, without any condescension, that explores the self-critical honesty to the maximum.\\n\\nIn an intimate and small scenic space, a slightly raised, long and narrow stage, of 2m x 10m, the presence of the mother will be a permanent evocation for the performer. Viewers in close proximity and in two bands, beyond the monolog, will be privileged witnesses of this essential confessional dialog between mother and child.\\n\\nFactsheet:\\n\\nLocation: Teatro Español - Sala Margarita Xirgu\\n\\nA show by: Édouard Louis\\n\\nAddress: Fernando Bernués\\n\\nTranslation: José Antonio Soriano\\n\\nAdaptation: Daniele Sarriugarte\\n\\nCast: Eneko Sagardoy and Eva Trancón\\n\\nDesign of scenic space: Fernando Bernués\\n\\nCostume design: Ana Turrillas\\n\\nLighting design: David Bernués\\n\\nA production of: Tanttaka Teatroa and Portal 71\\n\\nImage credit: © Remy Tortosa\\n\\nIt has a magnetic loop, amplified sound with headphones, audio description and overhead for the deaf.\",\n",

       "  'description': 'AFTER HIS TRIUMPH IN THE SPANISH THEATER WE RESCUED THIS COMEDY STARRING, IN THIS CASE, BY SILVIA MARSÓ AND PABLO RIVERO One of the most acidic and funny portraits that have never been made about social hypocrisy. Wilde wrote a perfect wink filled with dramatic wisdom and vital intelligence. With its unhinged aftershocks, the truth explodes in the faces of viewers, who constantly feel questioned.\\n\\nOverview\\n\\nPaco Nieva says that The importance of his name Ernesto is “a perfect dream of theater, a ruthless and eccentric comedy, perfect, beautiful and dreamlike the life of a rose on the strange walls of a vertical garden.” A delicate rose that reminds us of that ephemeral and revealing that beauty and life have.\\n\\nWilde wrote a perfect wink filled with dramatic wisdom and vital intelligence. With its unhinged aftershocks, the truth explodes in the faces of viewers who feel constantly questioned.\\n\\nWilde works a large number of territories through which his characters walk: love, desire, origins, commitment, hypocrisy, identity and, above all, freedom, his so esteemed freedom, to be who he was, and which led him to prison shortly after writing The importance of calling himself Ernesto. This sense of freedom is present throughout the function. And perhaps the clearest realization of this freedom we see in two of the female characters, Gwendolen and Cecily, who live their dream life with as much or more intensity than their real life. Where are the limits of each of us? Why do we self-censor? How can we fully become ourselves?\\n\\nAlthough it may be difficult to see, since we are facing a luminous comedy, within the importance... there is also a strong urge to die. Like any work of art that resonates with us, after more than a hundred years of its creation, what Wilde explains to us about how to live, is deeply linked to the fact that this of existing (that we know) only happens once and that our “stay” in this world only makes sense if we become free.\\n\\nArtistic file\\n\\nPlaywright: Oscar Wilde Address: David Selvas Cast: Silvia Marsó, Pablo Rivero, Paula Malia, Ferran Vilajosana, Paula Jornet, Albert Triola and Gemma Brió Abrazos.',\n",

Mathieu, an unlucky former composer, breaks the norm to discover the beauty of the world to educated young people under the harshness of the Second World War. With this approach, inspired by his own childhood and an old French film classic, Christophe Barratier created one of the truly unforgettable films of the early 21st century, enhanced by the sublime music of Bruno Coulais.\\n\\n“The Choir Boys, the Musical” is not just an adaptation of a film we all love. It is, at the same time, a commitment to talk about the need for music, art, for personal growth. As the ancient philosophers and thinkers used to say, it is not only that music loves the beasts (in this case, children who are more unruly than fierce), but that art is what makes us truly human. Without sensitivity, without delicacy, without the nuances that illuminate the soul and personality, we would not be free, much less get to know what others are inside.\\n\\n“The Choir Boys, the Musical” tells of the forgotten children but also of the path that crosses the rainbow and leads to the light of April. It speaks of innocence, of play, of love... It speaks of effort and solidarity, of work and enthusiasm... It speaks of life. Talk about art.\\n\\nPedro Villora, playwright.',\n",

       "  'description': \"COMPREHENSIVE THERAPY\\n\\n\\n\\nToni Roca has been teaching bread making courses for more than 10 years. There are few squares and slaps to sign up. Students who enroll know that Toni Roca courses are unique, the method starts from a simple and curious premise: “To make a good bread, you do not need the best flour or the freshest yeast, to make a good bread you only need to be well with yourself”. It's that simple.\\n\\n\\n\\nFor Toni Roca: “We are the bread we make”. A little crunchy bark can be synonymous with work problems, a crumb too dense is surely indicative of a crisis of couple, a bland bread, can only be the result of an unsatisfactory sex life. If you want to make good bread, you need to fix anything that doesn't work well in your life. And the course ensures that, after these sessions, the student will get to make an excellent bread. The learning system is very unorthodox. Students not only knead or control the oven temperature: they confess, cry, laugh, shout and free themselves. Improvements in bread – and in life – are immediately apparent. Three new students have signed up for this year's course, three students with totally different interests, wills and life moments.\\n\\n\\n\\nAn Integral Therapy is a comedy that questions our need to believe in something. The portrait of a society that seems to be eliminating religion but still has an obsessive need to believe, to have faith in something, something that helps us find meaning in our chaotic lives, even if that something is totally unheard of.\\n\\n\\n\\nTEXT AUTHORS\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nINGREDIENTS.\\n\\n310 gr. of flour 175 gr. of warm water 15 gr. of fresh baking yeast 1 teaspoon of salt\\n\\nPREPARATION\\n\\n1 - Mix well in a bowl the flour, yeast and salt.\\n\\n2 - Pour the water very slowly while stirring with a spoon, until a homogeneous mass is formed, take it out and knead a little.\\n\\n3 - Let the dough rest for 30 minutes to an hour, put in the greased bowl in a warm place covered with a kitchen cloth to grow.\\n\\n4 - We already have the dough to give it the shape we want.\\n\\n5 - Then we will give you a few small cuts to allow you to grow. Flour a baking sheet, place on top of our breads and sprinkle flour on top.\\n\\n6 - Preheat the oven to 220 degrees and put it about an hour.\\n\\n\\n\\n7 - Take out when we see that it takes its color.\\n\\n\\n\\nApparently a simple recipe. But following the steps one by one does not guarantee that the bread will go well. Because bread, like life, is not only a recipe, we must always bear in mind that there is a part of the process that we cannot control.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCristina Clemente\\n\\nMarc Angelet\\n\\n\\n\\nARTISTIC DATA SHEET\\n\\n\\n\\nCast: Antonio Molero, Angy Fernández, Esther Ortega and César Camino\\n\\nWith the collaboration of Julio Fàbregas\\n\\nAuthor: Cristina Clemente and Marc Angelet\\n\\nAddress: Marc Angelet y Cristina Clemente\\n\\n\\n\\nFACTSHEET\\n\\n\\n\\nAssistant Director: Beatriz Bonet\\n\\nSet design and costumes: Jose Novoa\\n\\nLighting design: Sylvia Kuchinow\\n\\nSound design: Angel Doors\\n\\nProduction: Carlos Larrañaga\\n\\nProduction Assistant: Beatriz Díaz\\n\\nProduction Assistant: Sabela Alvarado\\n\\nProduction Assistant: Ángel Plana Larrañaga\\n\\nTechnical direction: David González\\n\\nConstruction and scenography: Jorba-Miró\\n\\nPress: Ángel Galán Comunicación\\n\\nGraphic design: Work Studio – Alberto Valle and Raquel Lobo\\n\\nPhoto: David Ruano\\n\\nScene photography and video: Nacho Peña\\n\\nManagement and oversight: Alfonso Montón\\n\\n\\n\\nTickets on sale for the comic play Una Terapia Integral held at the Teatro Fígaro Adolfo Marsillach in Madrid.\",\n",

       "  'description': '\"Por la Calle de la Zarzuela\" is a concert-dramatized, which pays homage to the spirit and tradition of zarzuela, the genre chico and the Revista de Madrid. The story follows La Colasa, a street vendor selling tobacco and matches with a deep connection to the world of zarzuela and the city\\'s streets. Through storytelling and interactions with a variety of colorful characters, La Colasa takes the audience on an emotional journey through the cobbled streets of Madrid.\\n\\nThe work presents a series of musical numbers emblematic of the zarzuela, played by the characters and the choir, which capture the essence of the genre and life in the city. From classics like \"La Verbena de la Paloma\" to more contemporary compositions, each song and dance reflects the diversity and unique character of Madrid.\\n\\nBetween the musical moments, stories of love, friendship, challenges and triumphs are intertwined, exploring the complexity of urban life and human passions. The characters represent a wide range of experiences and perspectives, from chulapos and chulapas to petty thieves and ordinary citizens, all united by their shared love for zarzuela and the city of Madrid.\\n\\nAt the end of the play, La Colasa brings together all the characters and the audience to celebrate the rich cultural tradition of zarzuela and the vibrant spirit of the capital. With a mixture of nostalgia and joy, the work culminates in a vibrant tribute to the city and its musical legacy.\\n\\nIn short, \"Por la Calle de la Zarzuela\" is a play that offers an exciting and moving look at life in Madrid and the passion for zarzuela. It is a journey full of music, dance and emotions that celebrates the history and charm of the Spanish capital.',\n",

Played by three great actresses, Helena Ezquerro, Ascen López and Belén Ponce de León, who give life to three different generations of women, the work will be on display from April 2 to May 4, with performances from Tuesday to Sunday.\\n\\n“Home is where the heart is,” the English say, and while it is debatable, as is their Brexit, pee-flavored beer, or balconing, it is also very true. On the Long Way Back Home, “home” is understood as meaning “home,” with a capital H.\\n\\nThat place where you're supposed to be yourself, you have the support of your people, biologically connected to you or handpicked. In short, the place that brings you peace. Being away from Home is darkness, anxiety and vital disorientation; it is the longing that goes neither with money nor with bodies. Whoever had a Home knows it.\\n\\nThis work presents three generations of women: Filomena, who has already passed the nineties (that “difficult to kill” generation that lived our terrible postwar) spends her life without any incentive, wishing that the Lord would take her away; her daughter Begoña does what she can help to kill, convincing them to choose life without feeling especially good herself; and Luisa, granddaughter and daughter of the previous ones, recently housed under the same roof against her will because of “the juncture of the pussy” of the economy and that is passing the crisis between the twenties and the thirties, when the options to have the life that you dreamed of begin to reduce.\\n\\nThe three protagonists look for that mental place in which to be able to be and to find it are going to have to communicate, discover themselves... When it happens the secrets will come to light, the old wounds will bleed again and the shotguns will be cut down over the decades in a black comedy in which the light at the end of the tunnel may not be a train, but a place to call Home.

Thus, dance, music and words merge in order to create a sensory experience around the personal and the universal.\\n\\nThe piece takes as its starting point the experience of Ondina Maldonado herself in her process of gender transition. Through their experiences, they reflect on the social and cultural structures that still limit the free expression of identity. So, questions are raised like: What does it mean to be a man or a woman? What roles do social norms assign to us based on our gender?\\n\\nThe montage is not only a play, but also a tool of activism.

It was the market of the time and in it you could find houses of all kinds of trades, numerous activities have been celebrated in the square and that is why all the balconies of the building overlook it, being reserved those of the second floors for royalty, some of the celebrations are reflected in the lampposts that are in the square. In the center of the square is the statue of Felipe III, who ordered the construction of the square. Another curiosity is that the caves of the square were a refuge for Luis Candela, one of the most common criminals of the city for his robberies, he was compared to Robin Hood as he stole from the richest, only he did not share the wealth. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn the Plaza Mayor there are many activities you can do, from taking a walk, remember the history of the past in its lampposts or stores that still remain in it, eat a calamari sandwich, typical Madrilenian; or if you go at Christmas time, visit the flea market that they put every year, is certainly a good choice.',\n",

The palace's Genoa temporary exhibition halls will host a selection of works by Chinese grandmasters and renowned Spanish artist Antonio Lopez in front.\\n\\nOrganized by the Association for the Promotion of Artistic Exchange between Spain and China (APIAEC), the exhibition has already been seen in the cities of Hangzhou and Beijing before traveling to Spain. A unique exhibition resulting from an unprecedented collaboration between artists from both countries.\\n\\nCurators include two internationally renowned figures, Sir Nicholas Penny, art historian and former director of the National Gallery in London, and Cao Yiqiang, professor at the China Academy of Art and one of China’s most prestigious art critics today.\\n\\nThe exhibition presents the best works of three generations of artists from China and Spain, spanning half a century from the 1960s to today. A total of 100 works by 100 artists, showcasing a rich variety of styles and themes, reflecting the cultural and artistic diversity of the two countries. Among the artists are prominent masters from both countries such as Quan Shangshi, Jin Shangyi, Zhan Jianjun, Antonio López García, Isabel Quintanilla or Julio Vaquero.\\n\\nNotably, many of the Chinese artists taking part in the exhibition have been directly influenced by the celebrated Russian master, Ilya Repin, one of the greatest Russian masters of the 19th century. An influence that shaped the general characteristics of Chinese art during that period. The works on display illustrate efforts to absorb numerous technical influences, with the aim of developing Chinese oil painting as an art form with a distinctive Chinese identity.\\n\\nIn this way, the exhibition Beyond Realism: Figurative Art in China and Spain offers the public the possibility of knowing the contemporary figuration in its wide and increasingly strong route throughout this last half century.\",\n",

Its history is set in the German city of Nuremberg during the 16th century and focuses on a singing competition organized by the Guild of Master Singers, a society of musicians and poets. There appears Hans Sachs, an outstanding master singer who symbolizes a kind of voice of reason and tradition in the midst of the social and cultural changes that are taking place at the time.\\n\\nIn addition, the young and talented Walther von Stolzing arrives in Nuremberg to participate in the contest, but is not familiar with the strict rules and practices of the guild. But that's not all because Walther falls in love with Eva, Pogner's daughter, a wealthy guild member who has offered her hand in marriage as a winner's prize.\\n\\nIn this way, the opera explores topics such as love, the evolution of art, tradition and the relationship between innovation and the preservation of culture. It is joined by a soundtrack that features great choruses and exciting arias. Despite its quality, it is less known than other pieces of Wagner such as The Ring of the Nibelungo or Tristan and Isolde, although that does not take away so that it is considered a very important function within its operatic repertoire.\\n\\nArtistic file:\\n\\nMusic Direction - Pablo Heras-Casado\\n\\nStage Direction - Laurent Pelly\\n\\nCostumes - Laurent Pelly and Jean-Jacques Delmotte\\n\\nScenography - Caroline Ginet\\n\\nLighting - Urs Schönebaum\\n\\nChoir Direction - José Luis Basso\\n\\nAllocation:\\n\\nHans Sachs - Gerald Finley\\n\\nVeit Pogner - Jongmin Park\\n\\nKunz Vogelgesang - Paul Schweinester\\n\\nKonrad Nachtigal - Barnaby Rea\\n\\nSixtus Beckmesser - Leigh Melrose\\n\\nFritz Kothner - José Antonio López\\n\\nBalthasar Zorn - Albert Casals\\n\\nUlrich Eisslinger - Neal Cooper\\n\\nAugustin Moser - Jorge Rodríguez- Norton\\n\\nHermann Ortel - Bjørn Waag\\n\\nHans Schwarz - Valeriano Lanchas\\n\\nWalther von Stolzing - Tomislav Mužek\\n\\nDavid - Sebastian Kohlhepp\\n\\nEva - Nicole Chevalier\\n\\nMagdalene - Anna Lapkovskaja\\n\\nSereno - Alexander Tsymbalyuk\\n\\nChoir and Orchestra Holders of the Royal Theater\\n\\nProgram:\\n\\nMusic Drama in Three Acts\\n\\nMusic and script by Richard Wagner (1813-1883)\\n\\nPremiered at the Court Theater in Munich on 21 June 1868\\n\\nPremiered at the Teatro Real on March 18, 1893\\n\\nNew production of the Royal Theater, co-produced by the Royal Danish Opera in Copenhagen\",\n",

       "  'description': '<p>If you want to know the most avant-garde Madrid, you have to take this route in which we will visit, in a quiet walk, two of the most emblematic neighborhoods of the capital: Chueca and Malasaña. Without a doubt, walking next to some of its most symbolic places is the best way to understand where, how and why that cultural phenomenon of the 80s, known as La Movida Madrileña, arose. The young people of that time faced an uncertain future living frantically in the present between transgression, the Uncovering and the Movida. Our meeting point will be the Plaza de la Luna, next to the door of the San Martin de Tours Church, from there we will stroll towards the Malasaña neighborhood, still an icon of the Movida Madrileña and the urban tribes of the time. Today we can still find some places that were the musical temples of the moment, such as the Sala Maravilla, El Penta or El Tupperware. We will reach the heart of Malasaña, the Plaza del Dos de Mayo, but first we will show you some small Madrid wonders, such as the church of San Antonio de los Alemanes with its baroque architecture, the Teatro Lara and, going up Calle del Pez, the Bishop Theater. Did you know that it was founded in 1948 as a morning cinema? It was known as the Pez cinema. We will continue our tour towards the Plaza de Chueca. On our walk we will enjoy and learn about the buildings of interest that we will see, such as the Madrid History Museum, the San Ildefonso Market, the San Antón church or the Recogidas convent. If Malasaña was the epicenter of the Movida, Chueca is the epicenter of the LGTB movement. This neighborhood has become one of the most visited areas of Madrid with an enormous activity between shops, bars and cultural offer. Its square is always full of neighbors and tourists who like to enjoy its terraces. Without a doubt, Chueca is the fashionable neighborhood. We will finish our route contemplating the House of the Seven Chimneys that contains an old legend from the 16th century. Do you want us to tell you? Join us on this visit, we will surely surprise you!<br><br> <strong>Only groups of up to 6 people are allowed in this activity.</strong> If you are 7 or more people, you will be asked for a payment per person in advance to join the visit.</p><p>Free tour: Book for free and pay what you want at the end</p>',\n",

The starting point is the first documentary reference about flamenco: an article published in the newspaper El Espectador in 1847 entitled Un cantante flamenco (A flamenco singer).\\n\\nThe exhibition has more than 150 pieces gathering posters, clothing of some of the main references such as Camarón, Enrique Morente or Paco de Lucía, archival documents and press articles, along with photographs of Nicolás Müller, Martín Santos Yubero, Ramón Zabalza or Alberto García Alix. Most of these funds are part of the collections of the Regional Archive and the Regional Library of the Community of Madrid, together with private collections and foundations.\\n\\nIn this history of the century and a half, Madrid has had a fundamental role, since its origins, when it began to be an aspiration for the promises of hondo art. Flamenco in Madrid cannot be understood without the Teatro Pavón, Zambra, the first tablao founded in Spain, El Corral de la Morería and the dance academy Amor de Dios or the guitarists of the Ramirez or the Esteso-Conde.\\n\\nOver the years, places such as El Rastro or Caño Roto, in Carabanchel, which gave its name to the so-called “Caño Roto sound”, have acquired a Flemish personality of their own. The 1980s and 1990s witnessed the birth of the “young Flemish”, with Ketama proclaiming his classic Vente pa' Madrid, the consolidation of the “Flamenco Summit”, and the conquest of Paco de Lucía, Camarón and Enrique Morente from spaces such as Teatro Real or El Ateneo.\\n\\nImage credits:\\n\\nGirl with turret.

Eva Vilamitjana is the great-great-granddaughter of Marceline Orbés, one of the most famous clowns of the beginning of the last century, which filled large theaters around the world, but which nevertheless with the arrival of cinema fell into oblivion. With this work Eva wants to pay homage to the performing arts and the figure of her great-great-grandfather.\\n\\nFrom the movement, live music and technology applied to the scene, it offers a tour of the life of Marceline Orbés, a catalog of historical clown numbers and an aesthetic reflection on the artistic fact in this society and in that of the early 20th century.\\n\\nMarceline was born in Aragon in 1873 and established the lines of modern clown language in London. He was the most popular, applauded, and admired clown of the first decade of the twentieth century. Funny and original, his gags delighted viewers from Paris, London, Mexico and New York.\\n\\nHe was, without any doubt, one of the essential protagonists of the performing arts of his time and creator of new theatrical formats. Master of Charles Chaplin and referent of Buster Keaton. He would fill two daily roles at the New York Racecourse, the world's largest theater, where he was the headliner.\\n\\nA few years later with the emergence of cinema, theaters ceased to be the temples of entertainment. Some, like Charles Chaplin, knew how to adapt to the new times; others, like Marceline, had a tragic end and fell into absolute oblivion.\\n\\nHis great-great-granddaughter has wanted to get on stage since she was conscious.

A stage poem about the relationship between human beings and the Earth. A documentary look that contrasts two worlds – the city and the jungle – in the same experience.\\n\\nThe Conquest of the Pol Sud documents the journey back to its origins of a member of a community in the Brazilian Amazon. The trip starts from Germany, in the heart of Europe, to the interior of the jungle. At the same time, we are presented with two very different worlds.

A research work in the line of those carried out by the company, which explores the enormous possibilities of the combination of languages on stage.\\n\\nFor La Conquesta del Pol Sud, formal search is essential.

Later, we will focus on the ancient <strong>Sombra street</strong> , where there are three important points: there was the <strong>Music Academy, the Salaberry tannery and</strong> , most importantly, the <strong>house that saw one of the most important adoptive carabancheleras in history grow up</strong> : the writer and deputy <strong>María Lejárraga.</strong><br><br> In fact, María will appear in several sections of the route, since she lived and intensely described her childhood and adolescence in the old town of Carabanchel de Abajo.<br><br> We will leave Sombra Street in the direction of the old <strong>San Roque Street (today Padre Amigó)</strong> to admire <strong>Leandro Teresa\\'s old slaughterhouse.</strong> We will then take María Odiaga to <strong>enter the Torres Garrido neighborhood (1955).</strong><br><br> Our journey will continue towards <strong>Alba de Tormes street</strong> (one of the oldest in Carabanchel) to <strong>enter the Patilla park</strong> , where I will tell you about the Santa Cruz school, which we will see in the distance, and the <strong>Marquis of Ceriola</strong> , owner of the land. that today occupies that park.<br><br> Finally, <strong>we will continue through Alba de Torme</strong> s, while I introduce you to the Cuban Delights, the country house of the Count of Yumurí that at the end of the 19th century would be split in two to house it since 1910, in the <strong>part</strong> that remained <strong>closest to the town hall of Carabanchel de Abajo, known as the Press Colony.</strong><br><br> With the arrival of this colony <strong>, the \"New Carabanchel\" arose, a neighborhood full of modernist houses</strong> that first <strong>welcomed</strong> journalists and later <strong>artists and poets, including Manuel Machado, brother of Antonio Machado.</strong> Today, with a somewhat more decadent air, <strong>the colony survives the passage of time</strong> and, as you can see, <strong>some of its palaces remain practically</strong> the same since they were built in the 1910-1920s.<br><br> <strong>The route ends at the exit of the neighborhood, at the famous arch</strong> that invites you to discover this jewel of modernist architecture that we owe, in large part, to the little-known architect Felipe Mario López Blanco.<br><br> See you on this new route!!</p><p>Free tour: Book for free and pay what you want at the end</p>',\n",

       "  'description': '<p>In the 11th century, King Alfonso VI of Castile conquered Toledo and with it Madrid and all the surrounding villages, including Carabanchel. Years later, the crown ceded this small village to Count Pedro Manrique, whose heirs sold it for 100 maravedíes. In this purchase-sale contract the name of Carabanchel appears for the first time, although in the area where this route begins there are established settlements since at least the second century AD. On this route we will discover the origins of Carabanchel, as well as its neighbor most illustrious back in the eleventh century, a farmer named Isidro and one that surely all of you have heard of because centuries later he became the patron saint of Madrid. We will also delve into the hermitage of Santa María la Antigua, the oldest building in use in Madrid and the only Mozarabic church in the entire community, which is why it was declared an artistic monument of provincial interest in 1981. The small hermitage, formerly known as La Magdalena, It is located next to a large wasteland where the famous Carabanchel jail used to be, until it was demolished in 2008. In the 15th century, the hermitage was abandoned and the small town of Carabanchel was divided in two to found Carabanchel de Arriba and Carabanchel down. But what motivated that division? Those from Abajo occupied the area of the current municipal council, inaugurating the parish of San Sebastián Mártir in 1495. The tour of this visit ends in that square. But before arriving at the Plaza de Carabanchel, the old main square of the town, we will walk through the entire street of La Magdalena, current Monsignor Óscar Romero and that for several decades had the name of Cinco Rosas. Do you know why? On the walk I will tell you ... The population tended to grow towards the hermitage of La Antigua, which was recovered and rehabilitated in the 16th century. For this reason, in the kilometer that separates the hermitage from the parish there is a lot of history. There was a bullring there, also the famous La Mina fountain, which gives its name to the oldest football field in Madrid, that of RCD Carabanchel. In the vicinity of this street there was also the famous La Fosforera factory, economic engine of Carabanchel in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, and three important centers were built, eventually converted into schools: Santa Rita (which was the first reformatory in Spain) , the Ntra. Sra. del Carmen-Nájera (school of nurses) and the Santa Cruz, which emerged as an asylum for people without resources. Finally, before reaching the main square, we will remember the Cine Imperio, later converted into a famous nightclub, and I will tell you the history of the Junta building, the old Carabanchel town hall. Also, if we arrive at good time, you can visit the parish of San Sebastián. After this we can have a drink in the historic La Plaza bar, where you can see old photos of the neighborhood. During the tour we will also see some houses that remain in the old town, as Carabanchel annexed Madrid (by obligation, I will tell you why) in 1948. If the visit is short and you want to walk a little more, we can go through the door of the old Santa Cruz school (today La Milagrosa), cross the Carabanchel park and end up in the Colonia de la Prensa, an interesting art deco neighborhood built at the beginning of the 20th century and of which there is still some other interesting palace. In that case, the route would last until 2 hours and would end at Siglo Futuro street.</p><p>Free tour: Book for free and pay what you want at the end</p>',\n",

A team of professionals will give you the chance to fly over the outskirts of Madrid in this Tandem Paragliding flight.&nbsp; </p>\\n<p>To do a tandem flight you don\\'t need any kind of training or skills, nor any physical condition. The pilot will take care of everything and will give you the necessary explanations to make a good take-off and landing. The only thing he needs to do is to be able to run a few meters when taking off!</p>\\n<p>It\\'s quite simple, the pilot lifts the glider and the passenger only has to try to run forward without sitting down or jumping, even if there is a little wind. Let it be clear that you don\\'t \"jump\" off any cliffs. The take-offs are on grassy slopes and not very steep. The pilots are certified professionals with many years of experience in paragliding tandem, especially taking absolute beginners to the sky. In this way they can guarantee that you will have a lot of fun in complete safety.</p>\\n<p>Tandem flights are usually done in two different areas (depending on the wind direction).<br />- Orientation: South and West in Avila: Cebreros and Pedro Bernardo<br />- North facing: in Segovia: at the Somosierra and Arcones mountain passes.</p>\\n<p>- The distance from Madrid to any of these places is about 90/100 km.<br />- The flights are between 600/800 metres in altitude.<br />- The duration of the flight depends exclusively on the intensity of the wind at the time of take-off. Normally, it lasts between 15 and 30 minutes, but in the worst case, if there was no wind at all, it would go down slowly and glide for about 10/15 minutes more or less.</p>\\n<p>Watching life pass under your feet while you share the skies with the birds... this is freedom!</p>',\n",

Located in the heart of Madrid, Lavapiés and La Latina maintain their irregular layout of houses built at different heights and around a central patio: the corralas (a popular building model in the capital between the 17th and 19th centuries). Its ancient commercial tradition gives its name to many of its streets and squares, such as the Plaza de la Cebada, the Plaza de los Carros or the Plaza de la Paja. But, without a doubt, the best representation of this ancient tradition is found in the Rastro: the most famous open-air market in Madrid. These two neighbourhoods, which represent the best example of traditional castiza, have become the meeting point for very different cultures. In them, the popular legacy of Madrid coexists in perfect balance with the customs and traditions contributed by a well-established immigrant population, coming from different origins.

The first part of the course will focus on learning to inflate and control the canopy. This first phase will take place in an open and flat field. The first step will be going through the different parts of the paraglider and learning to inflate the canopy.</p>\\n<p>The process of inflating the canopy is done by running. Once you've managed to keep it completely vertical and control it at your will, you would have completed this first part. You'll be ready to continue into the second phase when you've passed the obstacle course.</p>\\n<p>On the second part of the course, you'll head to a hill with a maximum altitude of 30m where you'll practice taking off. In no time, you'll be flying downhill in a straight line! The objective of this part of the course is being able to use the paraglider correctly and smoothly.</p>\\n<p>Once you've finished this course, you'll have a good overview of what the full course is about. If you wish to continue, the&nbsp;6&nbsp;to 8-days full introduction course will continue into a third phase in which you'll learn to control the paraglider in high altitudes, taking off from up to 800m!</p>\\n<p>During every single attempt in this third part, one instructor will be at the landing spot and another at the take-off spot. Also, you'll be able to communicate with them by radio so they can guide you!</p>\",\n",

Cavestany along with Javier Gutiérrez and Luis Bermejo return to this unique show from ten years ago, a comedy of realistic and atrocious tone, in which we are shown how the voracity of the system makes us predators. The work can be seen from May 30 to June 30, with performances from Tuesday to Sunday.\\n\\nOn the first day of sales, people have entered in droves and there has been an accident at the department store. A security guard interrogates a businessman who came to buy a suit and has had something to do with the events. But what are the facts, exactly? And what danger lurks these two people?\\n\\nA black comedy in which two characters maintain an intellectual and physical pulse full of tension, rawness, suspense and delusional humor. The narrative takes place entirely in one location, although there are two others that are not seen and that pendulate over the story, like a ball of demolishing buildings about to impact: the calls from his house that the man receives by phone and the room annexed, where the watchman hides something that will mark the fate of both.\\n\\nThe work aims to alert, in a tone of realistic and atrocious comedy, about how the desire for the material perverts the most essential human nature.

Morau seeks to transfigure one legacy into another and generate a common place where the voices of different art forms can collaborate and inspire others.\\n\\nThus, the work pivots around photographic series such as Mil besos (2009) and Ángel gitano (2014), in which Afanador incorporated the image of flamenco in a very personal way in the contemporary visual language. And it is that these captures were taken in a black and white of high contrast under the sun of Andalusia to create shocking games of light and shadows.\\n\\nMarcos Mora Ureña, better known as Marcos Morau\\u200b, is a choreographer born in Onteniente (Valencia) in 1982. Also versed in photography and dramaturgy, he studied at the Higher Conservatory of Dance of Valencia and the Movement Research of New York (United States). In 2005 he founded his own company, La Veronal, a group instituted by professionals from dance, film, theater, literature and photography who bet on an artistic language between abstraction and storytelling with the intention of establishing culturally diverse spaces.\\n\\nBorn in 1959 in Bucaramanga (Colombia), Ruvén Afanador is a photographer famous for his distinctive style that combines elements of fashion, culture and sensuality. Afanador has collaborated with important fashion and society magazines such as Vogue, Vanity Fair, Elle or Rolling Stone.

The crockery is placed on a mirror suspended by four cables that trace an obsidian inverted pyramid made by Humberto Hernández. Ricardo Flores is the craftsman in charge of the ivory colored dishes that have subsequently been enameled in Spain.\\n\\nMatus brings together in this exhibition a series of photographs of two of the most important works of his artistic career: the intervention in the Piedra del Sol (2010) and the one in the Templete de San Pietro in Montorio de Bramante in 216. From both works Ihiotica derives: with breath and strike being this a palimpsestual exercise, from its sculptural and architectural strokes.

Faced with the temptation of having a small treasure under his belt as information, he has had the imperative need to tell the first human being who has crossed his path. The worst thing is that all this entails collateral damage. Most importantly, transform the story from start to finish as the secret is passed by word of mouth in such a way that it is ultimately unrecognizable.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn this story that you are about to see, there are going to be two mistakes: not knowing how to keep a secret and what is worse, not knowing how to report it. We live in the information age. We have to know how to filter everything that comes to us. Contrast. In many cases nothing is what it seems and what initially had an informative sense becomes a fake. Now it's called that, fake. But we'll talk about that another time. Now enjoy the play and if you don't like it, please don't tell anyone. Keep the secret.\",\n",

Likewise, the relationships between different Persian sahs and different Spanish monarchs or governments of the fifteenth, seventeenth, and nineteenth centuries, which produced impressive manuscripts and publications that are also preserved in the BNE, are often ignored. We know of these journeys by the texts that emerged from them, and many of their original manuscripts or absolutely unique pieces, are at the BNE, and will be exhibited in this exhibition.\\n\\nThe Persian culture has a very particular style of adorning and presenting his writings, which in his most relevant works are wrapped in unique linings. Written in Persian or Arabic, these compositions often feature illustrations that turn each sheet into a piece of art. We can observe its origin, its authors or what stories they contain, both the text itself and the one narrated in their writings, and we will admire the beauty of the drawings.\\n\\nThis collection of Persian documents of the BNE is unique and is exhibited for the first time as such, after a work of cataloging and analysis that allows to show as a whole a collection that is testimony of a much more splendid and beautiful history than perhaps we dare to imagine.',\n",

The Pietà adheres to the canvas ‘Saint Gregory the Great, Pope’ of the collection of the institution present since its creation 100 years ago. This painting of the precursor of Romanticism was unveiled in 2011 as a result of a study by Arturo Ansón Navarro, and was later subjected to technical studies at the Museo Nacional del Prado in 2013.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe artist from Zaragoza made this canvas during the years 1770-1771 and at the same time defined his most intimate style between 1771-1774. In the artist's work, the reminiscences of Carracci's work stand out, representing on the lap of Mary to Christ. The acquisition of the work by the Ministry of Culture makes it possible to visualize it in the state collections.

The social, cultural or political imposition of new taboos and new forms of correction and silence, the controversies about the content and limits of humor, the control of speeches and narratives on different political, war, religious issues, are aspects that make us wonder today about the existence of other forms of censorship.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe exhibition will be accompanied by guided tours and other academic activities, which will focus on the analysis of the exhibits.',\n",

Through unpublished documents such as letters and speeches, it is revealed how Unamuno, though reluctant to take root in any political party, left a significant mark on public opinion of his time, defying conventions and showing a constant commitment to his ideals.\\n\\nUnamuno, though never a politician in the strict sense, was an activist, expressing his desire to influence public opinion through his journalistic work. During events such as the Cuban War and the Montjuic processes, he was noted for his pacifist and anti-colonialist stances.\\n\\nSpain's neutrality during World War I strengthened its anti-monarchism, though it also exposed it to censorship. From Paris and then from Hendaye, he became a great opponent of the military regime, collaborating in underground magazines and using poetry as a political weapon. Despite being elected as a deputy in 1931, he soon left his seat in disagreement with politics.\\n\\nAfter the outbreak of the Civil War, Unamuno initially supported the insurgents, but soon publicly clashed against them. His critical stance was maintained until his death, denouncing both the rebels and Marxists and warning of the threat of a military dictatorship.\\n\\nImage credit:\\n\\nUnamuno in the Republican Circle of Vitoria.

Luis Martín-Santos was not only part of the clandestine resistance against the Franco regime, but also stood out as an intellectual committed to the social affairs of his time. Among the exhibited works you can see Time of Silence and Time of Destruction.\\n\\nThe exhibition, curated by Juliá Guillamon, goes beyond the chronology of Luis Martín-Santos by presenting in a visual way his most outstanding work, Time of Silence, which explores the reality of Madrid in the late 1950s, from bourgeois environments to shanty towns, through literary gatherings and the laboratory. The writings of Martín-Santos merge with the images of Martín Santos Yubero, a renowned photographer from the capital in that period. El Roto has also been asked to reconstruct the poignant atmosphere of Silent Time through a series of 21 illustrations.\\n\\nA similar action is performed with his second literary work, Time of Destruction. Four symbolic images are used to revive the plot, accompanied by a deep, beautiful and devastating monolog, played masterfully by actress Lydia Otto.\\n\\nThe commemorative exhibition highlights the importance of Luis Martín-Santos as a psychiatrist and renewer of the discipline, being the youngest director of a psychiatric sanatorium in Spain. In addition, it highlights his multifaceted work and his anti-Franco political commitment, which ended in arrests. The presentation also addresses his connection with Basque culture, his friendship with artists such as Eduardo Chillida and his role in the Academia Errante, an initiative that brought together intellectuals around culture and anti-Franco.',\n",

Today these traces can still be perceived in its buildings, monuments, urban layout and traditions.<br><br> During our route we will get to <strong>know</strong> some of the main <strong>monuments and buildings erected to pay homage to Franco's victory in the Moncloa District.</strong> We will enter the <strong>Parque del Oeste</strong> to locate the forts that are still standing and that were used by the insurgents to continuously attack the city. We will go up to the <strong>Temple of Debod</strong> , where the rebellious <strong>Cuartel de la Montaña was once located,</strong> and from there we will be able to see <strong>Cerro Garabitas</strong> , one of the places from which the center of Madrid was bombarded with howitzers. We will also visit the <strong>Conde Duque Barracks</strong> , which remained loyal to the Republic until the end and, later, we will walk to places that served to shelter the most precious assets of churches and palaces or anti-aircraft shelters to protect citizens from bombs. We will arrive at the old <strong>Escuelas Pías de San Antón</strong> , which served as a checkpoint and prison during the 1930s and we <strong>will end</strong> our tour <strong>on Madrid's Gran Vía</strong> , next to <strong>the Telefónica Building</strong> , <strong>from whose roof the Republican side watched Franco's advances through the Casa de Campo .<br></strong> We have designed an educational and entertaining route so that you can learn all the details of this important historical event in Madrid.<br> What are you waiting for? Book your place today and live history.<br><br> <strong>Only groups of up to 6 people are allowed in this activity.</strong> If you are 7 or more people, you will be asked for a payment per person in advance to join the visit.</p><p>Free tour: Book for free and pay what you want at the end</p>\",\n",

This initiative brought together great photographers from all over the world in Almeria in the early 1990s, a fact that was the origin of the current Andalusian Center of Photography.\\r\\n\\r\\nCurated by Professor Jesús Segura, this exhibition features 49 images of 16 photographers who originally took part in the IMAGINA Project and who expose the unique value of these works, advanced in their time. It also reveals a little-known facet of Henri Cartier-Bresson, who contributed drawings instead of photographs.\\r\\n\\r\\nVisitors can see the works of Spanish photographers Ouka Leele (first participating photographer in the project), Manuel Falces, Josep Vicent Monzó, Cristina García Rodero, Carlos Pérez Siquier and Toni Catany, and international artists such as Martin Parr, Sarah Moon, Douglas Keats, Sibylle Bergemann, René Burri, Krzysztof Pruszkowski, Arno Fischer, Ferdinando Scianna, William Klein and Mimmo Jodice.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe works selected for this exhibition have a clear documentary aesthetic and a disturbing poetics. All of them are grouped into three categories: Image ecologies, with photographs that explore the complex relationship between actors and the natural environment; Social criticism that includes snapshots that incite to reflect on relationships in community and their concerns; and Collective memory, which collects photographs that explore the memory that passes through the individual memory and is built in need of social interaction, culture, shared tradition and common history.\\r\\n\\r\\nImage credits:\\r\\n\\r\\n© Ouka Leele Series\\r\\n\\r\\n© Works Carlos Pérez Siquier\\r\\n\\r\\n© Sarah Moon\\r\\n\\r\\n© Martin Parr\\r\\n\\r\\n© Cristina García Rodero',\n",

To light new lights, more spiritual, more visceral, more authentic, towards which we can rise and follow. The search for a concrete truth that is found in the concreteness of bodies.

       "  'description': '«CHRONICLE OF MY OWN IGNORANCE ABOUT THE HISTORY OF SPAIN» BY ALBERTO SAN JUAN A musical comedy that starts from the myth of Don Juan to investigate the relationship between our present and the cycle that inaugurates the year 1492. A personal approach to the Reconquista, the expulsion of the Jews or the arrival in America, to think, with humor, how the “macho” is built in this territory. It is born of the desire to look at the invisible (or invisible) history of Spain, with the small hope of understanding things that serve life today, when the will to dominate and the predatory zeal on which we have built our societies threaten to liquidate us.\\r\\n\\r\\nSynopsis\\r\\n\\r\\nAm I a man? Or do I just look like a man? Am I white? Or do I just look white? Am I European? Or do I just look European? The Castilian military victory in 1492 culminates the colonization of the Hispanic territory and begins in America the same process. Modernity begins with the tearing of the plural community that inhabited this territory in an “us”, the good, and one “other”, the bad, condemned all for centuries. This theater piece starts from the myth of Don Juan to talk about the schizophrenic experience of being one of our own. Macho grita is a chronicle of my own blindness about the history of my country. A babbling attempt to approach the historical process by which the norm that establishes what it is to be Spanish is built.

       "  'description': \"Diario Vivo is the first and only live journalism show in Spain, a format that triumphs in cities like San Francisco, New York, Paris or Helsinki. Journalists, writers, artists and personalities from different walks of life gather on the boards to tell for the first time stories that have marked them. It's a unique show because it's not filmed. Each of these stories remains in the public's memory. More than 150 authors have gone through the stages of the 19 Diarios Vivos that have been held in Madrid, Barcelona, Zaragoza and Mérida, with participants such as Iñaki Gabilondo, Rosa Montero, Julio Llamazares and many more.\\n\\nWhere In Diario Vivo we have a clear reference: “Pop-Up Magazine”, born about ten years ago in California by the author-journalist Douglas McGray. Very similar initiatives have recently emerged successfully in France, Denmark, Holland, Belgium. And now in Spain, with Diario Vivo.\\n\\nWhy and why we live in the era of “post-truth”, of “fake news”, a panorama marked by a widespread distrust towards the media and narratives in general. Diario Vivo is a way for “storytellers” to regain credibility and legitimacy. In our view, they are indispensable to reading and deciphering our complex world. If these storytellers take a risk live, without intermediation of any kind, without any screen, the impact is greater and genuine. That's why a Living Journal is not recorded or photographed. It's the only way for what happens on stage to gain maximum force. Diario Vivo is a form of journalism with emotion.\",\n",

       "  'description': 'The Museo ABC hosts from March 13 to September 28 the exhibition Este Madrid whose central axis is to reflect the evolution of Madrid from then until today. Andrés Trapiello, who has been curator of this exhibition, offers several artistic views of the city of Madrid.\\n\\nMadrid has been the object of writing, pictorial reference and claim for multiple writers and artists. The capital has been portrayed in various forms, both in color and in black and white, showing its most popular, miserable, festive, decadent, modern and even postmodern image. Goya, Velázquez, Beruete, Galdós and Larra have been some of the wide amalgam of geniuses who have illustrated in their paintings or narrated in their poems the aspects of the city.\\n\\nThe ABC Collection presents a broad retrospective of Madrid, from Madrid more than a century ago to the community it is today. Andrés Trapiello is the curator in charge of this exhibition. Trapiello has made a complex and inspiring selection. “What I have done is, we would say, an essential one, the quietest and least anecdotal, that of the suburbs, the self-absorbed and poetic,” Trapiello mentions.\\n\\nScenes from Madrid. Sunday Rest (1904) by Francisco Sancha Lengo or Things from that Madrid (1957) by José Robledano Torres are some of the works that make up the exhibition.\\n\\nCredits and images:\\n\\nThings from that Madrid.
